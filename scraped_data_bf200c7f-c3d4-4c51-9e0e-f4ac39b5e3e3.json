Ready to see how it can transform your workflow? Why Video Automation is Essential in 2025 In 2025, video automation is not just a luxury—it’s a necessity. With over 500 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, standing out requires more than just creativity; it requires efficiency and scale. According to CalCalistech, internet traffic is projected to increase by 190 times this year​​. This highlights the growing demand for video content and the importance of producing high-quality videos consistently to capture and retain audience attention. Video automation allows creators to generate more content without sacrificing quality. By automating repetitive tasks, creators can focus on what truly matters: storytelling and engagement. Automation tools help streamline video production, reduce costs, and eliminate the need for extensive teams or resources. Additionally, businesses and brands are leveraging video automation to maintain a competitive edge. A survey by Wyzowl reported that 91% of businesses use video as a marketing tool, with 88% of marketers considering video an important part of their strategy​​. With the demand for video content rising, automation tools enable creators to keep up with the pace without burning out. Top 7 Software for Automated Video Creation 1.

ToolBaz Automate Video Scriptwriting ToolBaz’s AI Script Generator is a free tool that can be a game-changer for content creators.

It’s designed to save you time and effort in the writing process, especially when you’re stuck for ideas or running short on time. While it’s free, which is great for creators on a budget, remember that the AI-generated script is a starting point. You’ll likely want to review and tweak it to match your personal style and ensure it accurately represents your message. It’s a powerful tool to jumpstart your content creation, but your unique voice and perspective are still crucial to making the script truly your own. 4.

The tool’s AI is trained to recognize important elements such as changes in tone, emphasis, and subject matter, ensuring that the most impactful parts of your interview are captured. This can save hours of manual editing time, allowing creators to focus more on content creation and less on post-production. 5.

These tools offer many useful features that make video creation easier and faster.

Many tools also allow users to integrate their own images or video clips, adding a personal touch to the output. Some AI platforms specialize in creating talking head videos with virtual presenters, ideal for tutorials or corporate content, while others excel in producing animated explainer videos or short, dynamic clips for social media. Text-to-speech functionality is a standard feature in most tools, enabling the addition of voiceovers with minimal effort.

Users can choose from pre-designed templates and customize them to fit their needs, significantly reducing the time and effort required to start a project from scratch.

For example, Katalist offers seamless Adobe Premiere integration, allowing creators to refine their projects with advanced editing tools after using AI for initial production.

These can be really useful when we're just starting out. We should also check if the tool has good customer support in case we get stuck.

This constant innovation is transforming video production, making it more inclusive and efficient than ever before. ‍ Features of AI Video Generation AI video generators have changed how we make videos. These tools offer many useful features that make video creation easier and faster. Key Functionalities AI video generators have transformed the way we create content by automating the process of turning text into videos. Simply type in the desired content, and the AI generates corresponding visuals and audio, streamlining video production like never before. Many tools also allow users to integrate their own images or video clips, adding a personal touch to the output. Some AI platforms specialize in creating talking head videos with virtual presenters, ideal for tutorials or corporate content, while others excel in producing animated explainer videos or short, dynamic clips for social media. Text-to-speech functionality is a standard feature in most tools, enabling the addition of voiceovers with minimal effort. A standout feature of AI video generators is their extensive template libraries. Users can choose from pre-designed templates and customize them to fit their needs, significantly reducing the time and effort required to start a project from scratch. These functionalities make AI video generators versatile and efficient tools for creators of all skill levels. ‍ Advantages of using ai for video AI has drastically reduced the time required for video production. Tasks that used to take hours or even days can now be completed in minutes, allowing creators to produce more content at a faster pace. This efficiency is especially valuable for businesses and marketers who need to keep up with high content demands for social media and campaigns. The quality of AI-generated videos is often well-suited for social media, training, and marketing purposes. These tools can create professional-looking graphics, animations, and even background music tailored to the topic, making them ideal for quick yet impactful content creation. One of the biggest advantages of AI video generators is their accessibility. You don’t need advanced editing skills to use these tools—AI handles the technical aspects, from generating visuals to synchronizing audio. This empowers anyone, from solo entrepreneurs to small business teams, to create high-quality videos without relying on external expertise. AI also enhances the creative process. Many tools can suggest scripts, visuals, or design elements based on your topic, helping to overcome creative blocks and spark new ideas. This combination of speed, accessibility, and creative support makes AI video generators an essential tool for modern content creators. ‍ Considerations for choosing an ai video generator Picking the right AI video generator can make a big difference in your video creation process. We'll look at two key things to think about when choosing one. Compatibility with existing tools When selecting an AI video generator, it’s important to ensure it integrates seamlessly with the tools you already use. Generators that work well with popular software like Adobe Premiere or Final Cut Pro make it easier to incorporate AI-generated clips into larger projects without disrupting your workflow. For example, Katalist offers seamless Adobe Premiere integration, allowing creators to refine their projects with advanced editing tools after using AI for initial production. File compatibility is another key consideration. A good generator should allow you to import your own assets—such as brand colors, logos, and fonts—and export videos in formats that suit your needs. Katalist excels here, offering robust customization options to help creators maintain a consistent brand identity across their content. Ultimately, the best AI video generator is one that complements your current workflow, enhancing efficiency without forcing major changes. With tools like Katalist, you can integrate cutting-edge AI features into your existing processes, streamlining production while maintaining high-quality results. Ease of use and learning curve The best AI video generator is one we can actually use without a big headache. We want to look for a tool with a simple, clear interface. It should be easy to find the features we need and start making videos quickly. Some generators have drag-and-drop editors that make video creation a breeze. Others might need more time to learn but offer more control. We need to think about how much time we can spend learning a new tool. Many AI video generators offer tutorials or help guides. These can be really useful when we're just starting out. We should also check if the tool has good customer support in case we get stuck. Future trends in AI Video Generation AI video generation is set to change how we create and consume video content. New technologies will make videos more personalized, easier to produce, and better integrated with other tools. Increased personalization AI will allow for more customized video experiences. We'll see videos that adapt to each viewer's preferences and behavior. This could mean personalized ads that change based on who's watching. Or educational videos that adjust difficulty levels automatically. AI avatars will become more lifelike and diverse. They'll be able to mimic real people's expressions and movements. This will make training videos and online courses feel more engaging. Text-to-speech tech will improve too. It will sound more natural and be available in many languages. This will help content reach global audiences. More efficient production processes AI will speed up video creation. It will automate tasks like editing, color correction, and adding special effects. This will save time for both pros and beginners. We'll see more AI tools that can turn text into full videos. Just type in what you want, and the AI will create matching visuals and audio. This could change how we make ads, social media content, and even short films. AI will also help with video planning. It could suggest storylines, shot compositions, and even predict how well a video might perform online. Integration with other tools AI video generators will work better with other software. They'll connect smoothly with editing programs, social media platforms, and analytics tools. This integration will make it easier to create, publish, and track video performance all in one place. We'll see new workflows that combine AI video creation with live streaming and virtual reality. AI will also help match videos with the right audiences. It will analyze content and viewer data to suggest the best platforms and times to post videos for maximum impact. ‍ Conclusion AI video generators are no longer a futuristic concept—they’re a practical, powerful tool for content creators, businesses, and educators today.

      "content": "Presentación del Informe Nacional del Consejo Privado de Competitividad 2012-2013 - 8 de noviembre Presidencia de la República - Colombia 4 likes 850 views 8 Nov 2012 Palabras del Presidente Juan Manuel Santos en la apertura de la Presentación del Informe Nacional del Consejo Privado de Competitividad 2012-2013 - 8 de noviembre de 2012 2 comments pensé que lo más apropiado para el momento sería hacer un una charla sobre este concepto de la competitividad dentro de todo lo que hemos tratado de hacer aquí en Colombia desde que comenzamos hace 20 años y y hacer como una especie de análisis dónde estamos y Y para dónde vamos porque a veces cuando nos concentramos en los detalles dejamos de ver el contexto general y siempre es muy importante tener ese contexto general presente de manera que me perdonarán que no traje nada escrito ni ordenado más bien va a ser una charla un poco desordenada pero creo que es importante que que todos reflexionemos sobre el momento que estamos viviendo momento creo que muy especial que hemos logrado y Y qué nos falta en esto de la competitividad comienzo por por decir que el concepto de competitividad es un concepto muy discutido es un concepto Dinámico nació en forma paralela al proceso de globalización del mundo y al proceso de apertura de las economías me recuerdo perfectamente a comienzos de los 90s cuando nosotros abrimos la economía colombiana que fuimos por primera vez al Foro económico en davos y yo le pedí cita al profesor klaus schwab y al profesor jeffre Sax que en ese momento estaba dirigiendo el estudio de competitividad del foro económico mundial y les pedí que incluyeran a Colombia Nos gustaría mucho podernos comparar con el resto de los países lo hicimos por algo muy elemental de sentido común si nos estábamos abriendo a la economía mundial pues era bien importante saber dónde estábamos colocados y ese índice que publica el foro pues era un buen indicador para señalarnos dónde podríamos mejorar y dónde podríamos hacer un esfuerzo mayor para estar siempre ganando puntos ganando terreno en eso de la competitividad que además es un concepto Dinámico uno puede progresar pero si los demás países progresan más se queda uno rezagado es una competencia es una maratón y por eso pues desde entonces comienzos de los ventas nos propusimos que este concepto de la competitividad lo pudiéramos internalizar tanto a nivel de gobierno como a nivel de los empresarios recuerdo la dificultad no solamente con los funcionarios con la gente del gobierno sino con los propios empresarios acostumbrados muchos de ellos a no competir a tener unas de juego estables claras pero a nadie le gusta en el fondo si puede no competir tener que competir y desde entonces comenzamos a a tratar de identificar aquellos puntos donde es importante ponernos de acuerdo y avanzar para poder competir poder competir mejor desde entonces un principio básico que para mí ha sido muy importante que en cierta forma lo adquirí en mi experiencia con la federación de cafeteros fue la necesidad de de crear esa sociedad esa animus societatis entre el sector público y sector privado la concertación la necesidad de trabajar juntos porque hasta ese momento había una especie de animadversión como de prejuicio sector privado veía al sector público como una especie de enemigo y viceversa Cómo controlamos al sector privado cómo lo ponemos en cintura era el enemigo en cierta forma eso había que romperlo lo lo comenzamos a hacer yo creo que con bastante éxito inclusive institucionalmente comenzamos a a imponer una una nueva modalidad Entonces era Era nueva las instituciones del del Estado del gobierno con participación plena al sector privado cuando creamos el Ministerio de comercio exterior cuando creamos proexport cuando creamos bancoldex cuando creamos fiducoldex cuando creamos el consejo superior de comercio exterior eh le dimos una amplia participación al sector privado siempre dentro del dentro del el concepto de de de trabajar juntos Porque si queremos ser competitivos pues teníamos que romper ese prejuicio de ad adversión entre sector público y sector privado y todos estar jugando en la misma cancha y tratando de meter los goles en la misma dirección eso yo creo que ha avanzado bastante yo creo que hoy después 20 años más tarde podemos decir que aunque Todavía existe parte de ese prejuicio yo diría más que en lado del gobierno de los funcionarios de del sector público frente al sector privado y no viceversa que hemos roto eh esa ese ese obstáculo que para mí Era un obstáculo mayor y hoy podemos decir que este concepto de competitividad nos obliga necesariamente a trabajar juntos y y a trabajar en forma coordinada la competitividad tiene eh muchísimas facetas y tiene muchísimos factores al fin al cabo Qué es tividad Es simplemente eh el la capacidad de un país y o de una empresa para para hacer negocios para progresar para poder crecer para poder vender para ser competitivos como su nombre lo indica y y ahí fluyen eh todo tipo de factores a veces se nos olvida los factores Macro el el el contexto general y creo que en eso es bueno siempre resaltarlo para no olvidarlo para preservarlo y para mejorarlo hoy en día si uno pregunta alrededor del mundo Qué factor es el más negativo el factor que más frena el de la economía mundial el factor que más ha contribuido a las crisis que estamos sufriendo yo diría sin lugar a dudas que es el factor político la incapacidad de los países de tomar decisiones en forma oportuna decisiones muchas veces duras para poder afrontar unas circunstancias que siempre son cambiantes y frente a las cuales uno tiene que estar siempre preparado ahí por ejemplo en el caso colombiano Nosotros hemos afortunadamente logrado una gobernabilidad envidiable diría yo y así lo señalan todos los analistas Internacionales e la capacidad del Estado colombiano del gobierno del país para tomar decisiones eh en forma oportuna y decisiones importantes que mantienen y mejoran el contexto general dentro de los cuales tenemos que eh operar y para poder además afrontar los aspectos particulares la parte micro pues eso es algo que que tenemos nosotros que valorar apreciar y sobre todo estar conscientes Para no ir a deteriorarlo e esa gobernabilidad y por eso en el gobierno desde el primer día quisimos vender el el concepto de unidad nacional eh Para poder tomar medidas medidas que estábamos en Mora de de de tomar y y para poder aprobar reformas que estábamos necesitados de de pasar por el congreso eso nos ha dado un gran eh un gran eh eh prestigio y y una y una gran facilidad para poder avanzar en esto de la competitividad les pongo ejemplos el haber podido aprobar en el congreso de la República reformas que en cierta que en cierta medida garantizan A cualquier inversionista que la economía colombiana no va a tener esos venes y no va a sufrir esas crisis que hoy está sufriendo Europa inclusive Estados Unidos y que sufrimos nosotros hace algunos años no solamente aquí en Colombia sino en América Latina eso contribuye enormemente a mejorar la competitividad del país y de las empresas Cómo el haber logrado aprobar el concepto de sostenibilidad fiscal en el congreso en el el congreso para que se incluyera en la Constitución el haber aprobado la regla fiscal como una ley de la república que obliga a a los gobiernos cualquier gobierno a operar dentro de ciertos márgenes y evitar lo que hoy tienen muchos países europeos una deuda exagerada evitar la acumulación de déficit E eso eh imprime una un un un grado de confianza en la economía que se traduce en aspectos tan prácticos y tan directos como el costo del capital que es para cualquier empresa o para cualquier país un factor fundamental en su competitividad hoy una empresa colombiana cito la última empresa el último la última empresa que salió al mercado internacional a a financiarse el grupo aval hizo una emisión millonaria billonaria y logró captar recursos al 4. 8% algo así eh eso era impensable hace unos años eso tiene una repercusión muy importante dentro de todo El engranaje Financiero y el acceso al crédito de todas las empresas y del país en general el hecho de que Colombia esté hoy en el en el la lista de los países emergentes de JP Morgan en el famoso indicador envi como uno de los tres países con el costo más bajo es decir con el riesgo más bajo eso se traduce necesariamente en mejor acceso de cualquier empresa colombiana a los mercados en mejor acceso por supuesto del país con sus bonos soberanos a los mercados internacionales y en un crédito mucho más barato del que teníamos es que no se nos olvide que apenas hace 10 años nosotros estábamos en una situación eh bastante diferente a la que estamos hoy yo diría radicalmente diferente totalmente al el opuesto estamos at portas de que nos cerraran totalmente el crédito portas estuvimos de declarar una cesación de pagos precisamente porque no había confianza porque no había ningún tipo de de tranquilidad sobre el futuro de nuestra economía y eso nos lo ha permitido en cierta forma la gobernabilidad que hemos podido construir esa gobernabilidad nos ha permitido también aprobar unas reformas que han sido eh Muy bien recibidas por por el mundo en general por el país reformas que estábamos en Mora de de de aprobar e que antes precisamente por falta de gobernabilidad por razones políticas había sido imposible una de ellas es el la reforma a todo el sistema de regalías ustedes saben mejor que yo lo que ese sistema produjo en las últimas décadas eh regalías que se generaron pero que uno preguntaba de dónde están y nunca las vimos es regalías que estaban siendo distribuidas en forma muy inequitativa y y que era un un factor en lugar de de Progreso era un factor más bien de corrupción y de atraso esa reforma que se pensaba que era imposible de aprobar se aprobó y y después de de unas discusiones muy complejas Porque todo lo que tiene que ver con la distribución de presupuestos son discusiones muy complejas eso la esencia de los parlamentos en cualquier parte del mundo nacieron además para eso cómo se se distribuyen los recursos de un país Cómo se distribuye Cómo se distribuyen los presupuestos cada cual tiene su criterio cada cada cual tiene sus razones cada cual tiene sus argumentos pero después de un de una discusión muy amplia no solamente de la de cómo se va a a distribuir sino cómo se van a invertir esos recursos hoy finalmente podemos decir que eh ha comenzado a fluir Y eso va a tener un impacto importantísimo importantísimo en el desarrollo el desarrollo de las regiones y en el desarrollo del país en general eh el concepto fundamental que informó todo este proceso es un concepto que la historia nos ha enseñado que hay que aplicar en cualquier proceso de desarrollo y es que el desarrollo tiene que darse con un criterio regional con un criterio de corredores de desarrollo y Y eso es lo que hemos tratado de de imprimir en este nuevo esquema de regalías en en estos primeros meses o este año también por falta de de algo que estamos también tratando de de de internalizar en la mente de los colombianos de los funcionarios de los gobernantes territoriales eh alcaldes e gobernadores del propio gobierno y es la necesidad de tener de prever hacia el futuro y de tener un banco de proyectos un banco proyectos estructurados es Es realmente triste y preocupante que muchas veces vienen aquí fondos de inversión atraídos por por el milagro colombiano y dicen En qué podemos invertir y le preguntan a uno y muchas veces no hay que ofrecerles que no hemos tenido la precaución Y eso es eso no se da de la noche a la mañana eso tiene que hacerse poco a poco eh No hemos tenido la precaución de ir creando un banco de proyectos y de ir creando la disciplina de estructurar bien proyectos que están disponibles que cuando se presente la circunstancias se puedan financiar eso es lo que estamos haciendo en materia de infraestructura y estamos tratando de hacer en materia de desarrollo regional pero Us noo va y esa es la la verdad que estamos viviendo a muchos departamentos yce aquí hay 400,000 millones de pesos de regalías para proyectos de impacto en todo el departamento Deme un proyecto y no existen no hay entonces nos ha tocado eh comenzar a estructurar esos proyectos ahí esa ese matrimonio sector público sector privado los comités regionales de competitividad pueden aportar eh algo muy importante y es acelerar ese proceso porque los recursos están que nos ha tocado hacer pues a veces aprobar proyectos que no tienen realmente el impacto regional que deberían tener pero que no podemos Simplemente no aprobar recursos cuando se han generado tantas expectativas frente al proceso de las regalías pero lo que quiero Resaltar es que el esquema ya está marchando un esquema nuevo se demoró también por la la discusión de de no solamente de cómo se van a distribuir sino cómo se van a invertir quién Toma las decisiones siempre hay esa Esa pugna esa eh qué tanta injerencia tiene el gobierno central qué tanta Independencia tienen las las regiones eh Cómo puede uno conectar los proyectos para que tengan un sentido un sentido de desarrollo y que no vayan a a enfrentarse los conceptos de desarrollo regional con el concepto de desarrollo a nivel nacional finalmente eh logramos un un buen equilibrio que todavía está en proceso de de ir mejorando e por la experiencia que hemos tenido en las instancias de decisión pero creo que ese es un paso importantísimo que el país eh ha dado en el contexto general en contexto Macro para facilitar la competitividad eh a nivel eh empresarial el los Otro aspecto importante dentro dentro de lo Macro tiene que ver con los los indicadores tradicionales que se utilizan en en cualquier análisis económico de un país el tema de inflación y el tema del empleo el tema de inflación país desde desde hace 20 años tomó una decisión sabia creo yo eh de adoptar el sistema de inflación objetivo acuérdense que teníamos una de las inflaciones más altas de toda la región nos propusimos lentamente bajar esa inflación y hoy podemos decir que tenemos una de las inflaciones más bajas del continente y estable e ese es uno de los grandes logros que ha tenido el país en los últimos años que hay que preservar muchas veces se critica al banco de la República eh por su obsesión frente a la inflación entre otras cosas es lo que determina la constitución pero esa conquista no la podemos nosotros eh echar a al traste porque es una conquista importantísima eh un país con inflación baja es un país que va a estar siempre en mejores condiciones de competir y yo diría que uno de los grandes logros que hemos obtenido en los últimos años ha sido precisamente poder reducir la inflación a los niveles que tenemos hoy y tener un esquema un una banca central y un y un proceso que en cierta forma nos permite mantener una inflación baja el otro lado el emp empleo ahí hemos tenido siempre nosotros un un problema eh complicado un problema de informalidad un problema de altas tasas de desempleo por factores diferentes no voy a a entrar en analizar Pues el mercado de de trabajo es un análisis muy profundo pero Hay ciertos elementos que que que son obvios y que hemos querido ir ir mejorando poco a poco eh la parte de la informalidad la parte de la informalidad tiene que ver con las dificultades de los empresarios y el costo de los empresarios de eh de contratar tiene que ver también con eh la dificultad de de después de contratado si hay que despedir a una persona pues prácticamente imposible ydo tiene que ver con las leyes laborales y tiene que ver con Los costos laborales por eso por primera vez Ahora nos atrevimos a presentar en la reforma tributaria y le agradezco Dr David bojanini el apoyo que ustedes están dando a esta reforma comenzara a a tratar de mitigar esos obstáculos a la creación de empleo y empleo formal se sabe que los llamados parafiscales son uno de esos obstáculos estamos proponiendo eliminarlos reemplazar la fuente de financiación con otras fuentes Y eso debe contribuir a a ir mejorando que yo diría que no es es necesario pero no es suficiente vamos a tener que continuar en ese proceso para eso también quisimos presentar ante el congreso y se aprobó y con mucho éxito se ha venido materializando la ley del primer empleo para que ese segmento de la población donde hay el la tasa más alta de desempleo que son los jóvenes el primer empleo pues tenga una serie de facilidades para poderlo contratar Y creo que eso ha funcionado relativamente bien y hemos logrado en estos últimos dos años eh algo eh Muy muy importante sobre todo dentro del mundo que estamos viviendo que mes tras mes mes tras mes hemos venido creando empleo creando empleo Y eso eh En este contexto y en esta situación mundial pues no era fácil No ha sido fácil eh Lo importante es que ese empleo y ahí hemos fallado yo creo que en el sentido de de formalizar el empleo no hemos logrado que el empleo que se ha creado sea eh en su gran mayor mayoría empleo formal sí se ha creado mucho empleo formal pero no lo suficiente y ahí tenemos que hacer un gran esfuerzo un gran esfuerzo eh Para poder no solamente seguir creando empleo seguir bajando las tasas de desempleo sino también para formalizar el empleo es una necesidad desde muchos puntos de vista porque el empleo formal eh es lo que en el fondo mantiene los esquemas de seguridad social el empleo formal contribuye a esos esquemas de seguridad social y al contrario si no hay ese empleo formal los esquemas de seguridad social serán cada vez más precarios más débiles y estarían a la larga destinados a fracasar simple simple simplemente por porque cada vez va a haber menos gente contribuyendo y más gente beneficiándose de esos esquemas de seguridad por eso es tan importante ampliar la base del empleo ahí Creo yo que hay que hacer un gran esfuerzo desde el punto de vista Macro eh el la parte internacional cuando comenzamos a abrirnos al mundo e diseñamos un una estrategia identificamos unos países e todo conlleva por por supuesto un riesgo eh siempre que hay eh este tipo de aperturas Pues hay costos y hay beneficios siempre se trató de identificar esos mercados Donde había más beneficios que costos nunca esas decisiones son eh gratis siempre hay algún costo pero en términos generales ese proceso de de ir abriendo eh nuestro mercado y abriendo y mejorando el acceso de nuestro productos a los mercados internacionales pues si uno analiza lo que ha sucedido en estos 20 años pues ha sido Ah un un logro muy importante lo hemos acelerado en estos últimos 2 años y en qué forma pienso que el la aprobación del tratado de libre comercio con Estados Unidos que finalmente se logró pues era uno de los pasos importantísimos dentro de nuestro eh nuestra política comercial eso lo habíamos identificado desde que se creó el Ministerio de comercio exterior como uno de los propósitos inclusive cuando negociamos con México el G3 fue con ese propósito por eso negociamos eh las reglas de origen y muchos de las modalidades de de ese acuerdo comercial eh lo hicimos a imagen y semejanza del llamado nafta porque pensábamos que podíamos nosotros eh sumarnos a ese tratado de libre comercio nos tomó 20 años por otra vía y por otras rutas por dificultades que ustedes todos conocen pero ya hoy tenemos acuerdo de libre comercio con Canadá con Estados Unidos y con México que son mercados para Colombia importantísimos pero no solo eso Hemos en esa época hicimos un esfuerzo muy importante con los vecinos Venezuela Ecuador Perú dentro del marco de la comunidad andina de Naciones se llamaba el pacto andino que se transformó la comunidad andina de Naciones ustedes conocen las complicaciones que hemos tenido por razones políticas más que todo pero son mercados para nosotros naturales e importantes Yo diría que con el Ecuador e el comercio sigue en forma muy positiva ese mercado Hay que cuidarlo con Venezuela lo que hay que entender es que tenemos sistemas paradigmas completamente diferentes e en este momento un empresario colombiano y el gobierno colombiano y el modelo colombiano no encaja con el modelo venezolano Entonces es un comercio más administrado hay que entender eso para poder aceptar los riesgos como lo he dicho tantas veces es un mercado que de todas formas en el largo plazo es un mercado para nosotros importantísimo y que en estas circunstancias cada empresario debe asumir los riesgos de de un esquema diferente tratar de proteger o disminuir esos riesgos aprovechar los mercados si se puede el gobierno facilitará en la medida de lo posible que que así sea logramos que se pagaran las deudas que se que se tenían eh era un poquito más de 1000 millones de dólares se han pagado cerca de 950 o algo así casi 1000 millones eh hacia adelante pues seguirá siendo un comercio administrado pero es un país que requiere de productos que nosotros producimos y que a la larga va a ser un mercado importante de todas formas mientras eso sucede Pues también abrimos otros espacios otros espacios importantes e uno de los tal vez de los esquemas más interesantes que ha suscitado una un una un interés muy especial del mundo entero curiosamente es la alianza del Pacífico que creamos con México chile y Perú Ahí estamos avanzando en eh la integración tenemos tratado de libre comercio entre nosotros Nosotros con todos los todos los países tienen tratados entre sí que es una de las condiciones para poder ser miembro de ese de ese grupo pero lo que queremos es proyectarnos como como un mercado como un mercado eh que al fin al cabo es un mercado sumado más grande que Brasil con un ingreso per cápita Más alto que Brasil e y el la relación con con el Asia eh A través de la alianza por el Pacífico Fede una relación no solamente comercial sino geopolítica bien importante presidente lagos estuvo recientemente aquí en Colombia me decía hombre eh estúdios Cómo la alianza del del del Atlántico se se gestó aquí hay unos elementos muy parecidos aprovechen Y ustedes verán como muchos países comienzan a a interesarse eh por este grupo dentro de un contexto texto más amplio de geopolítica para tener un relacionamiento con el con el Asia Pacífico y efectivamente lo que está sucediendo países que no pertenecen al Pacífico están tratando de ingresar pequeños como Uruguay pero inclusive países europeos Italia España están queriendo participar en principio como observadores ahí hay un potencial enorme que bien manejado para Colombia puede ser algo de veras importante pero lo que quiero Resaltar en la parte internacional lo que hemos lo que hemos logrado conquistar no solamente en materia de de acuerdos comerciales sino el posicionamiento de Colombia eh los cambios que que hemos tenido en los últimos años y Y cómo el mundo percibe a Colombia es es también un factor muy importante dentro de la competitividad si es un jugador importante un jugador que tienen en cuenta que lo lo escuchan y lo oyen eso Abre puertas eso facilita muchas políticas internas Al fin y al cabo la política exterior es el reflejo de de muchas de las políticas internas que tenemos y yo diría que estamos muy bien posicionados y ese es otro de los activos que tenemos que cuidar la nueva posición que Colombia ha adquirido a nivel internacional Ahora somos jugadores importantes en el fondo monetario en el g20 inclusive nos invitaron esta en esta ocasión a participar con con toda la la autoridad y la la vocería del caso y fue de veras motivo de orgullo que en México en la última reunión del g20 varios países señalaron a Colombia como un ejemplo de un país que logró salir de una crisis y que ha logrado manejar su situación macroeconómica de forma tal que ha evitado que las crisis posteriores lo hayan afectado en forma grave y nos tuvimos la oportunidad de expresarles a los países del g20 la experiencia nuestra Cómo manej amos la crisis financiera de los de comienzos de los del año 2000 año 2000 2001 Cómo fortalecimos el el el sector financiero las regulaciones que impusimos cómo mejoramos las finanzas de las regiones de los municipios los esquemas que pusimos en marcha la famosa ley 617 y cómo eso nos permitió que la crisis del 2008 2009 prácticamente no fuéramos afectados y que hoy aunque nos está afectando la crisis pues está afectando en una forma mucho menos grave de lo que está afectando a otros países eh eso tiene su valor eso tiene eh un una importancia y eso ese posicionamiento hay que mantenerlo y cultivarlo a nivel ya más político el hecho de que Colombia haya logrado su escaño en la el Consejo de Seguridad eh que se nos Termina ahora el 31 de diciembre pero que nos permitió jugar en los grandes escenarios internacionales y jugar con con con una presencia decorosa y y y que Y respetada creo que eso es bien importante cualquier país que que mantiene ese tipo de de posicionamiento internacional pues Por supuesto que le va a representar eh crédito en sus políticas internas con Estados Unidos ustedes son testigos de las dificultades que tuvimos durante tanto tiempo hoy en día estamos en una situación privilegiada este este mes Vamos a a tener una eh una reunión de una instancia que creamos una instancia de en el tema de la seguridad de alto nivel que Estados Unidos no tiene sino con muy pocos países tiene con Gran Bretaña tiene con Corea del Sur tiene con Australia y tiene con la otá y ahora lo abrió con Colombia para hablar sobre temas de seguridad no solamente bilaterales sino regionales y vamos a ver cómo colaboramos a nivel regional Estados Unidos Colombia en Centroamérica en en el Caribe en la región en general ampliamos la agenda con Estados Unidos para salirnos simplemente de la agenda típica de lucha contra el terrorismo lucha contra el narcotráfico ahora Estamos hablando de ciencia y tecnología de Educación cooperación en el medio ambiente en muchos otros frentes hemos normalizado Por así decirlo la nuestra agenda internacional y eso dentro de la competitividad del país pues es bien importante usted mencionaba doctor David el tema que es también muy importante la justicia aquí sucedió algo pues que no es tan tan raro que suceda Pues que se concentraron todos los la atención de la opinión pública en la famosa reforma constitucional a la justicia y se eh se descuidó o no se descuidó Simplemente no se le dio importancia a las otras reformas que se estaban aprobando en el congreso en materia de Justicia que tienen un impacto mucho más importante en la competitiva del país de lo que hubiera tenido esa reforma constitucional que En buena hora se hundió por lo que sucedió a último momento pero si ustedes analizan las reformas que se aprobaron el código del proceso en la parte de de la las instancias de arbitraje tanto nacional como internacional en la otra la otra reforma que que hicimos fue el código nacional Ah el código de procedimiento que cuando uno lo analiza y el impacto que eso tiene en la agilidad de la justicia esas reformas que se que se aprobaron en forma paralela al fracaso o a la no aprobación de la Reforma constitucional mucho más importante para la competitividad del país de lo que era esa reforma constitucional estamos haciendo un gran esfuerzo lo primero que hicimos con las Cortes fue sentarnos a ver si desde el punto de vista administrativo sin necesidad de reformas constitucionales podemos mejorar eh el funcionamiento de la justicia y hemos avanzado muchísimo estamos dando unos recursos importantes nos propusimos por ejemplo eh tener más temprano que tarde el expediente virtual ir sistematizando todo lo que tiene que ver con la justicia darle acceso a los ciudadanos a la justicia por la vía del internet y eso va a facilitar enormemente ese aspecto de la competitividad en materia internacional Se me olvidaba mencionar un objetivo que nos propusimos desde el primer día del gobierno que tiene muchísimo que ver con con esto la competitividad y y fue el ingreso nuestro a la osd como ustedes me han escuchado muchas veces la ocd no es un club de países ricos es una instancia de países con las mejores prácticas que están discutiendo permanentemente eh las mejores prácticas en en muchos de los aspectos que determinan la competitividad de un país allá en la ocd estudian los mercados laborales allá en la ocd estudian el las políticas de inversión todo lo que tiene que ver realmente con la competitividad y el y un país como Colombia poder ingresar a ese a ese instancia pues es un paso enorme que nos Además nos Amarra nos obliga eh De por vida a mantener un estándar mínimo en materia de competitividad eh algo que también en cierta forma se logra con Los acuerdos eh comerciales bilaterales el acuerdo con Estados Unidos El acuerdo con Europa que debe estar debe estar siendo aprobado en en Cuándo va a ser aprobado en Bruselas el 11 de diciembre eso nos Amarra también a unos estándares mínimos de comportamiento que tiene que ver mucho con la competitividad est me da pena con ustedes pero es que hablando de la parte internacional el presidente Obama me va a hacer o nos va a hacer los colombianos un gran homenaje Y es que dentro de los cinco países que van hablar con él para felicitar quiere que el primer país latinoamericano sea Colombia y ahí está el teléfono me esperan un momentico y ya les decía la osd hemos avanzado muchísimo hemos hecho la tarea con con mucha disciplina acuérdense chile se propuso como objetivo como un objetivo de estado Catarina cuánto tiempo como 8 años eh nosotros ya tenemos ya estamos en varios comités eh eso es un proceso complejo donde lo van midiendo van midiendo al país en cada comité Cómo cumple Cómo progresa y en la medida en que ven que hay suficiente terreno conquistado entonces ahí hacen una especie de invitación formal al país para ingresar hemos avanzado muchísimo Según dice el secretario general de la de la oec Ángel gurría estamos muy bien posicionados Vamos a ver en qué momento posiblemente el próximo año nos nos inviten Si eso es así rompíamos récord porque creo que ningún país ha ingresado tan rápido en 3 años a a esta organización de todas formas ya ya el solo hecho de estar ahí en ese proceso nos obliga Y eso es lo importante a todos a mantener unos estándares en muchas de nuestras políticas por ejemplo ahí hay un un comité de lucha contra la corrupción específicamente contra el soborno ellos han visto con muy buenos ojos lo que hemos aprobado aquí con nuestro est estatuto anticorrupción eh las medidas que hemos venido tomando para evitar la corrupción los sistemas que hemos venido implantando en materia de licitaciones la transparencia de sus sistemas todo eso es sujeto a un escrutinio permanente que nos retroalimenta y nos y nos indica si estamos haciendo las cosas bien o no y y ahí hemos aprovechado eso para ir avanzando en muchos en muchos frentes por ejemplo la licitación que hicimos hace unos unos meses por 1.2 billones de pesos en materia de infraestructura la forma como se abrió esa licitación los las modalidades de de adjudicación fueron inclusive elogiadas por los perdedores es eso en instancias como la oecd es muy apreciado y además ratifican que ese es el tipo de medidas que van abonando uno el terreno para el ingreso eh a esa a esa organización e yo estoy también Totalmente de acuerdo doctor David con usted cuando dice que la madre de las locomotoras es la educación e yo yo lo llamo es uno de Los Rieles uno de Los Rieles el país que quiera sobrevivir en el mundo tiene que darle mucha importancia a la educación Ahí infortunadamente estamos atrasados estamos atrasados en la calidad hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo en aumentar la cobertura eh ustedes son conscientes pues conocen muy bien el esfuerzo que hicimos para darle eh una gratuidad eh total a los niños y niñas que vayan a los establecimientos públicos educativos públicos del grado cer al grado 11 en el esfuerzo que se está haciendo para ir mejorando eh la calidad las pruebas saber estamos tratando también de hacer unos exámenes no cada 4 5 años sino cada año o cada 2 años para ir tratando de mejorar nuestra posición en esos en esas pruebas Porque si hay algo importante en materia de competitividad frente a otros países es eso porque yo no me canso de decir que cualquier persona que se gradúe de cualquier universidad aquí en Colombia en cualquier sitio no está compitiendo solamente con con sus pares aquí en Colombia está compitiendo en el fondo en un mundo Cada vez más globalizado con sus padres en China en París en en Nueva York o en Argentina y eso es lo que tenemos que entender por eso en esa en materia de Educación tenemos que hacer un mayor esfuerzo ahí una mayor cooperación sector público y sector privado es necesaria Yo pienso que por ejemplo la la los vasos comunicantes entre las empresas y las universidades se pueden mejorar mucho se puede retroalimentar mucho más y con el propio sena Yo sé que hay y sé que se está haciendo pero ahí si hacemos un esfuerzo conjunto mayor podemos producir mejores resultados estamos comenzando a tener problemas de cuellos de botella en en muchos frentes de trabajo capacitaciones en en actividades específicas que si hubiéramos sabido que se requerían con con con más tiempo pues hubiéramos podido poner en marcha eh las los procesos de capacitación para que esos cuos de botería no se presentaran Y eso se hace Es con esos vasos comunicantes entre el sector público y el sector privado la pertinencia de la educación y la pertinencia de de la capacitación es es fundamental ahí tenemos que hacer un gran trabajo Nosotros hemos estado infortunadamente pues es un problema que lleva ya muchos años décadas eh eh descuidando desatendiendo todo lo que tiene que ver con la capacitación técnica y tecnológica en un país que que no tiene esa especie de de de instancia en materia de oferta de mano de obra bien capacitada pues va a tener dificultades en su competitividad Ahí estamos tratando de de ir corrigiendo eso eh pero es importante hacer un esfuerzo mayor eh dentro de ese esa esa concertación sector público y sector privado sobre todo anticipándose e en esto el que tiene cierta visión y se anticipa pues va a a quedar en mucho mejor posicionado para para poder competir eh hemos hecho un esfuerzo grande en en tratar de de mejorar la cobertura de de la educación superior se ha aumentado Yo diría que no es suficiente Y ahí podemos también eh hacer un esfuerzo un esfuerzo mayor se están acreditando muchas de las universidades mejorando la calidad eh Y y en eso pues cualquier cosa que se haga en materia de educación es bienvenida porque ese sí que es un aspecto importantísimo y ahí me lleva eso al a la parte de la innovación y la productividad dentro de las regalías como les hablaba la reforma ustedes conocen muy bien ese 10% que se destinó a la a la innovación a la ciencia la tecnología estamos discutiendo todavía ya se creó pues una instancia pero eso hay que irlo calibrando para ver esos recursos Cómo se invierten de la mejor forma posible mi mi intuición me dice que si podemos lograr sinergias con el sector privado eh Y y ubicar y e invertir esos recursos para obtener los mayores resultados con el sector privado sería la mejor forma de invertir esos esos recursos que no se sector privado también tiene mucha eh Muchos vasos comunicantes con el tipo de investigación que se puede hacer no solamente para mejorar la productividad en el sector privado sino para ir descubriendo y ampliando fronteras dentro de nuestro propio país e Este es un Este es un un mundo donde nosotros tenemos un gran potencial pero que infortunadamente no hemos desarrollado las destrezas apropiadas hasta ahora Estamos dándole la importancia eh el porcentaje de recursos que el país le ha invertido a las ciencia tecnología son mínimos frente a las necesidades y ahí es ahí hay un área donde si no hacemos lo lo lo correcto Pues nos vamos a quedar retrasados de por vida Por qué es tan importante la innovación y y Por qué es tan importante esa investigación porque para qué quiere ser uno competitivo pues para poder producir más para poder crecer más el crecimiento digamos es una condición necesaria para poder para poder generar el bienestar el empleo eh los las variables con que mide uno el éxito de una economía nosotros queremos montarnos en eh la senda del crecimiento positivo alto y de largo plazo pero cuando uno hace un análisis de cómo Cuáles son las fuentes de ese crecimiento y cuál han sido las fuentes del de crecimiento de los países que han logrado crecer a tasas altas durante mucho tiempo descubre uno que los factores tradicionales que han sido los factores de crecimiento de Colombia nuestros recursos naturales la minería el petróleo la industria los factores tradicionales explican un porcentaje de ese crecimiento el el resto lo explica Un aumento en productividad que se da por por aspectos como la innovación por eso es tan importante repito Si queremos tener una economía con un crecimiento relativamente alto y sostenido en el tiempo es absolutamente indispensable que podamos internalizar lo la necesidad de innovar permanentemente y que el componente de mayor productividad se convierta en un componente que explique por lo menos diría yo un 2% 25% del crecimiento de otra forma no vamos a poder sostener porque los recursos naturales son finitos no podemos seguir creciendo simplemente a punta de de de exportaciones de Carbón eso eso no es un crecimiento sostenible en largo plazo entre otas cosas el carbón bajado de precio en los últimos meses de 120,75 nadie se preveía eso por qué sucedió eso Simplemente porque Estados Unidos descubrió un sistema para para producir más gas y entonces en lugar de volverse de continuar como importador de Carbón ahora Estados Unidos está exportando carbón y le está exportando a nuestro mercado tradicional que es Europa entonces son factores que están por fuera de nuestro de nuestra digamos capacidad de dominarlos y por eso Si queremos ser sostenibles en largo plazo ese aspecto de la innovación la tecnología es tan importante y eso es una cultura que infortunadamente nosotros la Hemos descuidado hasta ahora la estamos la estamos eh asimilando Esa fue la razón por la cual además en en nuestro último viaje a China paramos en Singapur porque los campeones de la innovación los que realmente han logrado posicionarse como innovadores natos son eh son las empresas en Singapur el gobierno y empresas y quisimos parar allá y pedirle al al Primer Ministro de Singapur que solamente nos ayude en eso que nos ayuda a capacitar y a internalizar y a poder asimilar los procesos y las instancias y las instituciones que fomenten ese ese esa palabra mágica que se ha vuelto tan importante que es la innovación dentro de eso la innovación pues está también la utilización de las tecnologías que uno puede ahorrarse varios pasos como un atajo eh en materia de Educación si uno logra una correcta aplicación de la tecnología pues puede acelerar eh el incremento el mejoramiento de la calidad de Educación y en una forma importante de ahí el objetivo que tenemos que nos propusimos de desde el primer día de conectar la mayor cantidad de hogares al internet y sobre todo de darle a los a los estatos más bajos acceso a esa tecnología ustedes ven que por ejemplo en estas las 100,000 casas que vamos a darle los más pobres de los pobres todas esas casas van a tener conexión a internet y todas esas casas van a tener un subsidio de 300,000 pesos para que compren un computador eh Y estamos y aquí el sector privado puede colaborar mucho eh buscando todas las mejores formas para que las aplicaciones pasado para que Cómo se utiliza esa tecnología tenga un impacto En aquellos factores de competitividad sobre todo en materia de Educación estamos abriendo lo que llamamos los puntos vive digital por todo el país estuve el sábado pasado el último que abrimos fue en Valle dupar esos muchachos esos niños que por primera primera vez tienen acceso a esa tecnología la capacidad y la rapidez con que asimilan eso Si uno encausa esa capacidad tecnológica en materia de Educación y cada punto de esos video digital tiene unas pantallas de la con la última tecnología para enseñarle a los niños con las pantallas electrónicas todo tipo de capacidades por ejemplo en materia de matemáticas y y de lenguas Y eso ahí hay una oportunidad de dar un brinco importante en materia de calidad ahí hemos avanzado bastante 2.2 millones de hogares estan conectados ya lamos como 5.8 5.9 esperamos terminar el cuatrenio con 8.8 millones que son casi el 50% y los colegios todos los colegios estamos dando computadores estamos fando el uso de la tecnología dónde hemos encontrado algunas dificultades hemos encontrado unos unos docentes muy entusiasmados muy muy comprometidos pero otros que que dicen no pues a mí me queda 5 años y me voy a jubilar Yo que voy a ponerme a aprender de computadores a estas alturas Y si los docentes no se entusiasman con eso el esfuerzo se puede se puede trancar ahí también podemos podríamos hacer un esfuerzo conjunto de estimular a a a los docentes y y ver cómo podemos internalizar también ese uso de la de la tecnología de la mejor forma posible porque eso repito nos va a permitir eh Elevar la calidad de la educación Y lograr los objetivos en materia de competitividad mucho más rápido que por los caminos tradicionales y eso la de la tecnología y la innovación casi que están eh Como casados está Son son dos dos conceptos que se se entrelazan el uno con el otro el acceso a la tecnología en cierta forma eh facilita la innovación y viceversa y por eso esos dos aspectos son tan importantes eh hemos eh hecho bueno el uno de los factores que ustedes saben perfectamente que Colombia ha estado muy atrasado eh en en materia de competitividad pues es nuestra infraestructura las quejas vienen desde la época en que abrimos la economía cómo nos va a poner a competir con x o y país y si un contenedor que sale de Bogotá a Buenaventura pues cuesta el triple de lo que puede costar de Buenaventura a Hong Kong y ese ha sido un cuello de bía enorme ahí también hemos hecho un esfuerzo que visto desde el punto de vista de del Progreso que se está logrando es un esfuerzo realmente importante solamente para darles un orden de magnitudes nosotros invertí más o menos el 1% del pib cerca de 3 billones de pesos en infraestructura por año eh decidimos cambiar eso fundamentalmente nos propusimos Buscar los mecanismos de poder hacerlo preservando las limitaciones Fiscales y preservando los objetivos Fiscales de llegar a equilibrio fiscal el año entrante y encontramos los mecanismos a través de la ley de Apps que aprobamos en el congreso y nos propusimos mejorar la institucional idad y nos propusimos también mejorar la forma de estructurar los proyectos y de adjudicar los proyectos y hoy tenemos ya en marcha unas unos proyectos que hace unos años creo que nadie se podía imaginar que íbamos a poder lograr poner a funcionar estuve hace dos días en un sitio de de control de la de la carretera Bogotá y villavicencio es que es un desastre un desastre porque no se previó el aumento del tráfico pero cuando ve uno las especificaciones de lo que se está construyendo e en materia de cosas tan simples pero tan importantes como las pendientes o la curvatura eh los túneles los viaductos Pues estamos construyendo comenzando a construir realmente de autopistas que no tienen nada que enviarle a las autopistas en Italia o en Suiza o en Alemania son autopistas realmente de Gran envergadura lo que se está haciendo en las autopistas eh de la prosperidad allá en en Antioquia las especificaciones son eh autopistas de estándares absolutamente internacionales que no tienen que enviarle a ningún otro país a tal punto que tenemos en materia de para el contexto esto de la comparación 3 billones que era lo que lo que invertí 6 billones invertimos el año pasado pero lo que vamos a hacer hacia hacia adelante este año y y lo que viene son si sumamos lo que vamos a entregar en concesiones más las propuestas que hemos recibido de Apps suman 58 59 billones de pesos fíjense lo que eso significa de una inversión de 3 billones a una inversión de casi 60 o sea eh 20 veces más eso yo espero que en unos años pues podamos ver realmente Una Revolución un país diferente un país diferente donde efectivamente un contenedor de Bogotá a Buenaventura eh En lugar de costar $3000 pues cueste 1000 y podamos ser competitivos eh e ahí Creo que el El Progreso que estamos haciendo es bien importante no sin dificultades eh ustedes son testigos y son son eh además víctimas Pues de el tema de las licencias el tema de las comunidades el tema de de de las eh eh de las eh expropiaciones de los terrenos y todos los litigios que hay ahora nació uno nuevo en creíamos que teníamos ya todo solucionado para para la vía a Buenaventura la corte acaba de darle a una comunidad una tutela que suspende nuevamente una una una obra que estamos haciendo allá porque esa comunidad es que no se había incluido en la consulta todo eso pues son son temas que hay que ir resolviendo y que estamos con todo el propósito de resolverlo eh que son dificultades eh que se presentan pero que son superables en fin ya me estoy alargando más de la de la cuenta lo que quiero es decirles que el contexto general de del país en este momento el el el ambiente Macro eh el ambiente económico internacional en comparación con el con lo que estamos haciendo aquí en Colombia todo eso influye muchísimo en la competitividad del país y ya los los aspectos puntuales del informe que ustedes están presentando Pues el gobierno está más que dispuesto a sentarse a irlo arreglando uno por uno e yo hablaba con el presidente de Chile en Chile tienen una persona no un grupo de personas dedicadas exclusivamente y solamente al a los indicadores de competitividad alimentar es es algo que podíamos hacer nosotros doctor Sergio alimentar a los a las instancias que publican esas esas esos índices de competitividad Yo tuve la oportunidad como les decía al principio con y con Je analizar el primer la primera participación nuestra en materia de competitividad eso lo han venido digamos cambiando mejorando lo del World Forum es una cuestión de percepción y F con esto termino si tuviéramos una mayor comunicación con el podríamos a veces corregir algunas calificaciones negativas si damos más información objetiva porque no es que vamos a dar información que no sea real acabamos de de hacer el estudio más completo que se ha hecho en el país en materia de victimización qué descubrimos que nosotros somos bastante masoquistas en materia de seguridad por digo que bastante masoquistas lo digo yo como antiguo periodista le damos el tema de la seguridad por supuesto producto de la violencia que hemos vivido no eso no es inventado Eso es Es real si ha habido un país que ha que ha sufrido la violencia y ha sufrido en seguridad pues ha sido Colombia pero la mejora en seguridad eh No se ha traducido en la mejora de percepción de seguridad eh Y esa ese estudio de victimización lo lo prueba ya con cifras en términos generales las ciudades colombianas no tienen una victimización mayor al promedio de las ciudades en el resto del mundo estamos más o menos dentro del promedio promedio es más o menos el 20% de la gente que fue consultada que fueron más de 178000 personas fue en los últimos dos meses víctima de algún tipo de delito de algún tipo ese promedio es parecido al promedio de muchas ciudades pero pero cuando les pregunta uno usted se siente inseguro de ese 20% sube a 61 O sea que la percepción de inseguridad frente a la realidad de victimización hay un una una instancia enorme Entonces si hay un problema y ahí lo comprueba de percepción no queremos decir que estemos viviendo un paraíso Tenemos muchos problemas en algunas zonas los problemas se han agravado pero pero en términos generales nosotros nos encargamos nosotros mismo nos encargamos de alimentar la percepción de inseguridad que por lo menos no guarda ninguna relación con la realidad en materia de victimización si uno ve el World economic Forum dónde estamos en materia de seguridad la percepción Pues nos coloca en los últimos lugares entonces ahí hay un un tema doctor Sergio como de mejorar nuestra lo que hace chile mejorar la comunicación con esas instancias para darles la información más Ob eh Y ahí podemos seguir mejorando De todas formas este proceso de de de ser más competitivos pues es un proceso como les decía al principio de mejoramiento continuo permanente todos los países en una u otra forma están haciendo lo mismo que nosotros todas las empresas ustedes lo saben mejor que que yo están haciendo lo mismo cómo somos más competitivos para llegar al al mercado con un producto de mejor calidad con un producto más barato en los países hacen mismo eso es lo que tenemos que estar revisando permanentemente por eso esta instancia instancias como estas son tan importantes y repito eh la concertación sector público y sector privado eh es fundamental nosotros como país estamos compitiendo frente a otros países no estamos compitiendo entre nosotros tenemos que ayudarnos mutuamente para ser más competitivos eh Y por parte del gobierno lo único que van a recibir Ustedes es puertas abiertas y voluntad de ayudar a mejorar la competitividad de todos y cada uno de ustedes eh Por algo también muy sencillo si a ustedes les va bien al gobierno también les va le va mejor eh estamos en la misma Barca y remando en la misma dirección Muchas gracias",
      "title": "Presentación del Informe Nacional del Consejo Privado de Competitividad 2012-2013 - 8 de noviembre Presidencia de la República - Colombia 4 likes 850 views 8 Nov 2012 Palabras del Presidente Juan Manuel Santos en la apertura de la Presentación del Informe Nacional del Consejo Privado de Competitividad 2012-2013 - 8 de noviembre de 2012 2 comments pensé que lo más apropiado para el momento sería hacer un una charla sobre este concepto de la competitividad dentro de todo lo que hemos tratado de hacer aquí en Colombia desde que comenzamos hace 20 años y y hacer como una especie de análisis dónde estamos y Y para dónde vamos porque a veces cuando nos concentramos en los detalles dejamos de ver el contexto general y siempre es muy importante tener ese contexto general presente de manera que me perdonarán que no traje nada escrito ni ordenado más bien va a ser una charla un poco desordenada pero creo que es importante que que todos reflexionemos sobre el momento que estamos viviendo momento creo que muy especial que hemos logrado y Y qué nos falta en esto de la competitividad comienzo por por decir que el concepto de competitividad es un concepto muy discutido es un concepto Dinámico nació en forma paralela al proceso de globalización del mundo y al proceso de apertura de las economías me recuerdo perfectamente a comienzos de los 90s cuando nosotros abrimos la economía colombiana que fuimos por primera vez al Foro económico en davos y yo le pedí cita al profesor klaus schwab y al profesor jeffre Sax que en ese momento estaba dirigiendo el estudio de competitividad del foro económico mundial y les pedí que incluyeran a Colombia Nos gustaría mucho podernos comparar con el resto de los países lo hicimos por algo muy elemental de sentido común si nos estábamos abriendo a la economía mundial pues era bien importante saber dónde estábamos colocados y ese índice que publica el foro pues era un buen indicador para señalarnos dónde podríamos mejorar y dónde podríamos hacer un esfuerzo mayor para estar siempre ganando puntos ganando terreno en eso de la competitividad que además es un concepto Dinámico uno puede progresar pero si los demás países progresan más se queda uno rezagado es una competencia es una maratón y por eso pues desde entonces comienzos de los ventas nos propusimos que este concepto de la competitividad lo pudiéramos internalizar tanto a nivel de gobierno como a nivel de los empresarios recuerdo la dificultad no solamente con los funcionarios con la gente del gobierno sino con los propios empresarios acostumbrados muchos de ellos a no competir a tener unas de juego estables claras pero a nadie le gusta en el fondo si puede no competir tener que competir y desde entonces comenzamos a a tratar de identificar aquellos puntos donde es importante ponernos de acuerdo y avanzar para poder competir poder competir mejor desde entonces un principio básico que para mí ha sido muy importante que en cierta forma lo adquirí en mi experiencia con la federación de cafeteros fue la necesidad de de crear esa sociedad esa animus societatis entre el sector público y sector privado la concertación la necesidad de trabajar juntos porque hasta ese momento había una especie de animadversión como de prejuicio sector privado veía al sector público como una especie de enemigo y viceversa Cómo controlamos al sector privado cómo lo ponemos en cintura era el enemigo en cierta forma eso había que romperlo lo lo comenzamos a hacer yo creo que con bastante éxito inclusive institucionalmente comenzamos a a imponer una una nueva modalidad Entonces era Era nueva las instituciones del del Estado del gobierno con participación plena al sector privado cuando creamos el Ministerio de comercio exterior cuando creamos proexport cuando creamos bancoldex cuando creamos fiducoldex cuando creamos el consejo superior de comercio exterior eh le dimos una amplia participación al sector privado siempre dentro del dentro del el concepto de de de trabajar juntos Porque si queremos ser competitivos pues teníamos que romper ese prejuicio de ad adversión entre sector público y sector privado y todos estar jugando en la misma cancha y tratando de meter los goles en la misma dirección eso yo creo que ha avanzado bastante yo creo que hoy después 20 años más tarde podemos decir que aunque Todavía existe parte de ese prejuicio yo diría más que en lado del gobierno de los funcionarios de del sector público frente al sector privado y no viceversa que hemos roto eh esa ese ese obstáculo que para mí Era un obstáculo mayor y hoy podemos decir que este concepto de competitividad nos obliga necesariamente a trabajar juntos y y a trabajar en forma coordinada la competitividad tiene eh muchísimas facetas y tiene muchísimos factores al fin al cabo Qué es tividad Es simplemente eh el la capacidad de un país y o de una empresa para para hacer negocios para progresar para poder crecer para poder vender para ser competitivos como su nombre lo indica y y ahí fluyen eh todo tipo de factores a veces se nos olvida los factores Macro el el el contexto general y creo que en eso es bueno siempre resaltarlo para no olvidarlo para preservarlo y para mejorarlo hoy en día si uno pregunta alrededor del mundo Qué factor es el más negativo el factor que más frena el de la economía mundial el factor que más ha contribuido a las crisis que estamos sufriendo yo diría sin lugar a dudas que es el factor político la incapacidad de los países de tomar decisiones en forma oportuna decisiones muchas veces duras para poder afrontar unas circunstancias que siempre son cambiantes y frente a las cuales uno tiene que estar siempre preparado ahí por ejemplo en el caso colombiano Nosotros hemos afortunadamente logrado una gobernabilidad envidiable diría yo y así lo señalan todos los analistas Internacionales e la capacidad del Estado colombiano del gobierno del país para tomar decisiones eh en forma oportuna y decisiones importantes que mantienen y mejoran el contexto general dentro de los cuales tenemos que eh operar y para poder además afrontar los aspectos particulares la parte micro pues eso es algo que que tenemos nosotros que valorar apreciar y sobre todo estar conscientes Para no ir a deteriorarlo e esa gobernabilidad y por eso en el gobierno desde el primer día quisimos vender el el concepto de unidad nacional eh Para poder tomar medidas medidas que estábamos en Mora de de de tomar y y para poder aprobar reformas que estábamos necesitados de de pasar por el congreso eso nos ha dado un gran eh un gran eh eh prestigio y y una y una gran facilidad para poder avanzar en esto de la competitividad les pongo ejemplos el haber podido aprobar en el congreso de la República reformas que en cierta que en cierta medida garantizan A cualquier inversionista que la economía colombiana no va a tener esos venes y no va a sufrir esas crisis que hoy está sufriendo Europa inclusive Estados Unidos y que sufrimos nosotros hace algunos años no solamente aquí en Colombia sino en América Latina eso contribuye enormemente a mejorar la competitividad del país y de las empresas Cómo el haber logrado aprobar el concepto de sostenibilidad fiscal en el congreso en el el congreso para que se incluyera en la Constitución el haber aprobado la regla fiscal como una ley de la república que obliga a a los gobiernos cualquier gobierno a operar dentro de ciertos márgenes y evitar lo que hoy tienen muchos países europeos una deuda exagerada evitar la acumulación de déficit E eso eh imprime una un un un grado de confianza en la economía que se traduce en aspectos tan prácticos y tan directos como el costo del capital que es para cualquier empresa o para cualquier país un factor fundamental en su competitividad hoy una empresa colombiana cito la última empresa el último la última empresa que salió al mercado internacional a a financiarse el grupo aval hizo una emisión millonaria billonaria y logró captar recursos al 4. 8% algo así eh eso era impensable hace unos años eso tiene una repercusión muy importante dentro de todo El engranaje Financiero y el acceso al crédito de todas las empresas y del país en general el hecho de que Colombia esté hoy en el en el la lista de los países emergentes de JP Morgan en el famoso indicador envi como uno de los tres países con el costo más bajo es decir con el riesgo más bajo eso se traduce necesariamente en mejor acceso de cualquier empresa colombiana a los mercados en mejor acceso por supuesto del país con sus bonos soberanos a los mercados internacionales y en un crédito mucho más barato del que teníamos es que no se nos olvide que apenas hace 10 años nosotros estábamos en una situación eh bastante diferente a la que estamos hoy yo diría radicalmente diferente totalmente al el opuesto estamos at portas de que nos cerraran totalmente el crédito portas estuvimos de declarar una cesación de pagos precisamente porque no había confianza porque no había ningún tipo de de tranquilidad sobre el futuro de nuestra economía y eso nos lo ha permitido en cierta forma la gobernabilidad que hemos podido construir esa gobernabilidad nos ha permitido también aprobar unas reformas que han sido eh Muy bien recibidas por por el mundo en general por el país reformas que estábamos en Mora de de de aprobar e que antes precisamente por falta de gobernabilidad por razones políticas había sido imposible una de ellas es el la reforma a todo el sistema de regalías ustedes saben mejor que yo lo que ese sistema produjo en las últimas décadas eh regalías que se generaron pero que uno preguntaba de dónde están y nunca las vimos es regalías que estaban siendo distribuidas en forma muy inequitativa y y que era un un factor en lugar de de Progreso era un factor más bien de corrupción y de atraso esa reforma que se pensaba que era imposible de aprobar se aprobó y y después de de unas discusiones muy complejas Porque todo lo que tiene que ver con la distribución de presupuestos son discusiones muy complejas eso la esencia de los parlamentos en cualquier parte del mundo nacieron además para eso cómo se se distribuyen los recursos de un país Cómo se distribuye Cómo se distribuyen los presupuestos cada cual tiene su criterio cada cada cual tiene sus razones cada cual tiene sus argumentos pero después de un de una discusión muy amplia no solamente de la de cómo se va a a distribuir sino cómo se van a invertir esos recursos hoy finalmente podemos decir que eh ha comenzado a fluir Y eso va a tener un impacto importantísimo importantísimo en el desarrollo el desarrollo de las regiones y en el desarrollo del país en general eh el concepto fundamental que informó todo este proceso es un concepto que la historia nos ha enseñado que hay que aplicar en cualquier proceso de desarrollo y es que el desarrollo tiene que darse con un criterio regional con un criterio de corredores de desarrollo y Y eso es lo que hemos tratado de de imprimir en este nuevo esquema de regalías en en estos primeros meses o este año también por falta de de algo que estamos también tratando de de de internalizar en la mente de los colombianos de los funcionarios de los gobernantes territoriales eh alcaldes e gobernadores del propio gobierno y es la necesidad de tener de prever hacia el futuro y de tener un banco de proyectos un banco proyectos estructurados es Es realmente triste y preocupante que muchas veces vienen aquí fondos de inversión atraídos por por el milagro colombiano y dicen En qué podemos invertir y le preguntan a uno y muchas veces no hay que ofrecerles que no hemos tenido la precaución Y eso es eso no se da de la noche a la mañana eso tiene que hacerse poco a poco eh No hemos tenido la precaución de ir creando un banco de proyectos y de ir creando la disciplina de estructurar bien proyectos que están disponibles que cuando se presente la circunstancias se puedan financiar eso es lo que estamos haciendo en materia de infraestructura y estamos tratando de hacer en materia de desarrollo regional pero Us noo va y esa es la la verdad que estamos viviendo a muchos departamentos yce aquí hay 400,000 millones de pesos de regalías para proyectos de impacto en todo el departamento Deme un proyecto y no existen no hay entonces nos ha tocado eh comenzar a estructurar esos proyectos ahí esa ese matrimonio sector público sector privado los comités regionales de competitividad pueden aportar eh algo muy importante y es acelerar ese proceso porque los recursos están que nos ha tocado hacer pues a veces aprobar proyectos que no tienen realmente el impacto regional que deberían tener pero que no podemos Simplemente no aprobar recursos cuando se han generado tantas expectativas frente al proceso de las regalías pero lo que quiero Resaltar es que el esquema ya está marchando un esquema nuevo se demoró también por la la discusión de de no solamente de cómo se van a distribuir sino cómo se van a invertir quién Toma las decisiones siempre hay esa Esa pugna esa eh qué tanta injerencia tiene el gobierno central qué tanta Independencia tienen las las regiones eh Cómo puede uno conectar los proyectos para que tengan un sentido un sentido de desarrollo y que no vayan a a enfrentarse los conceptos de desarrollo regional con el concepto de desarrollo a nivel nacional finalmente eh logramos un un buen equilibrio que todavía está en proceso de de ir mejorando e por la experiencia que hemos tenido en las instancias de decisión pero creo que ese es un paso importantísimo que el país eh ha dado en el contexto general en contexto Macro para facilitar la competitividad eh a nivel eh empresarial el los Otro aspecto importante dentro dentro de lo Macro tiene que ver con los los indicadores tradicionales que se utilizan en en cualquier análisis económico de un país el tema de inflación y el tema del empleo el tema de inflación país desde desde hace 20 años tomó una decisión sabia creo yo eh de adoptar el sistema de inflación objetivo acuérdense que teníamos una de las inflaciones más altas de toda la región nos propusimos lentamente bajar esa inflación y hoy podemos decir que tenemos una de las inflaciones más bajas del continente y estable e ese es uno de los grandes logros que ha tenido el país en los últimos años que hay que preservar muchas veces se critica al banco de la República eh por su obsesión frente a la inflación entre otras cosas es lo que determina la constitución pero esa conquista no la podemos nosotros eh echar a al traste porque es una conquista importantísima eh un país con inflación baja es un país que va a estar siempre en mejores condiciones de competir y yo diría que uno de los grandes logros que hemos obtenido en los últimos años ha sido precisamente poder reducir la inflación a los niveles que tenemos hoy y tener un esquema un una banca central y un y un proceso que en cierta forma nos permite mantener una inflación baja el otro lado el emp empleo ahí hemos tenido siempre nosotros un un problema eh complicado un problema de informalidad un problema de altas tasas de desempleo por factores diferentes no voy a a entrar en analizar Pues el mercado de de trabajo es un análisis muy profundo pero Hay ciertos elementos que que que son obvios y que hemos querido ir ir mejorando poco a poco eh la parte de la informalidad la parte de la informalidad tiene que ver con las dificultades de los empresarios y el costo de los empresarios de eh de contratar tiene que ver también con eh la dificultad de de después de contratado si hay que despedir a una persona pues prácticamente imposible ydo tiene que ver con las leyes laborales y tiene que ver con Los costos laborales por eso por primera vez Ahora nos atrevimos a presentar en la reforma tributaria y le agradezco Dr David bojanini el apoyo que ustedes están dando a esta reforma comenzara a a tratar de mitigar esos obstáculos a la creación de empleo y empleo formal se sabe que los llamados parafiscales son uno de esos obstáculos estamos proponiendo eliminarlos reemplazar la fuente de financiación con otras fuentes Y eso debe contribuir a a ir mejorando que yo diría que no es es necesario pero no es suficiente vamos a tener que continuar en ese proceso para eso también quisimos presentar ante el congreso y se aprobó y con mucho éxito se ha venido materializando la ley del primer empleo para que ese segmento de la población donde hay el la tasa más alta de desempleo que son los jóvenes el primer empleo pues tenga una serie de facilidades para poderlo contratar Y creo que eso ha funcionado relativamente bien y hemos logrado en estos últimos dos años eh algo eh Muy muy importante sobre todo dentro del mundo que estamos viviendo que mes tras mes mes tras mes hemos venido creando empleo creando empleo Y eso eh En este contexto y en esta situación mundial pues no era fácil No ha sido fácil eh Lo importante es que ese empleo y ahí hemos fallado yo creo que en el sentido de de formalizar el empleo no hemos logrado que el empleo que se ha creado sea eh en su gran mayor mayoría empleo formal sí se ha creado mucho empleo formal pero no lo suficiente y ahí tenemos que hacer un gran esfuerzo un gran esfuerzo eh Para poder no solamente seguir creando empleo seguir bajando las tasas de desempleo sino también para formalizar el empleo es una necesidad desde muchos puntos de vista porque el empleo formal eh es lo que en el fondo mantiene los esquemas de seguridad social el empleo formal contribuye a esos esquemas de seguridad social y al contrario si no hay ese empleo formal los esquemas de seguridad social serán cada vez más precarios más débiles y estarían a la larga destinados a fracasar simple simple simplemente por porque cada vez va a haber menos gente contribuyendo y más gente beneficiándose de esos esquemas de seguridad por eso es tan importante ampliar la base del empleo ahí Creo yo que hay que hacer un gran esfuerzo desde el punto de vista Macro eh el la parte internacional cuando comenzamos a abrirnos al mundo e diseñamos un una estrategia identificamos unos países e todo conlleva por por supuesto un riesgo eh siempre que hay eh este tipo de aperturas Pues hay costos y hay beneficios siempre se trató de identificar esos mercados Donde había más beneficios que costos nunca esas decisiones son eh gratis siempre hay algún costo pero en términos generales ese proceso de de ir abriendo eh nuestro mercado y abriendo y mejorando el acceso de nuestro productos a los mercados internacionales pues si uno analiza lo que ha sucedido en estos 20 años pues ha sido Ah un un logro muy importante lo hemos acelerado en estos últimos 2 años y en qué forma pienso que el la aprobación del tratado de libre comercio con Estados Unidos que finalmente se logró pues era uno de los pasos importantísimos dentro de nuestro eh nuestra política comercial eso lo habíamos identificado desde que se creó el Ministerio de comercio exterior como uno de los propósitos inclusive cuando negociamos con México el G3 fue con ese propósito por eso negociamos eh las reglas de origen y muchos de las modalidades de de ese acuerdo comercial eh lo hicimos a imagen y semejanza del llamado nafta porque pensábamos que podíamos nosotros eh sumarnos a ese tratado de libre comercio nos tomó 20 años por otra vía y por otras rutas por dificultades que ustedes todos conocen pero ya hoy tenemos acuerdo de libre comercio con Canadá con Estados Unidos y con México que son mercados para Colombia importantísimos pero no solo eso Hemos en esa época hicimos un esfuerzo muy importante con los vecinos Venezuela Ecuador Perú dentro del marco de la comunidad andina de Naciones se llamaba el pacto andino que se transformó la comunidad andina de Naciones ustedes conocen las complicaciones que hemos tenido por razones políticas más que todo pero son mercados para nosotros naturales e importantes Yo diría que con el Ecuador e el comercio sigue en forma muy positiva ese mercado Hay que cuidarlo con Venezuela lo que hay que entender es que tenemos sistemas paradigmas completamente diferentes e en este momento un empresario colombiano y el gobierno colombiano y el modelo colombiano no encaja con el modelo venezolano Entonces es un comercio más administrado hay que entender eso para poder aceptar los riesgos como lo he dicho tantas veces es un mercado que de todas formas en el largo plazo es un mercado para nosotros importantísimo y que en estas circunstancias cada empresario debe asumir los riesgos de de un esquema diferente tratar de proteger o disminuir esos riesgos aprovechar los mercados si se puede el gobierno facilitará en la medida de lo posible que que así sea logramos que se pagaran las deudas que se que se tenían eh era un poquito más de 1000 millones de dólares se han pagado cerca de 950 o algo así casi 1000 millones eh hacia adelante pues seguirá siendo un comercio administrado pero es un país que requiere de productos que nosotros producimos y que a la larga va a ser un mercado importante de todas formas mientras eso sucede Pues también abrimos otros espacios otros espacios importantes e uno de los tal vez de los esquemas más interesantes que ha suscitado una un una un interés muy especial del mundo entero curiosamente es la alianza del Pacífico que creamos con México chile y Perú Ahí estamos avanzando en eh la integración tenemos tratado de libre comercio entre nosotros Nosotros con todos los todos los países tienen tratados entre sí que es una de las condiciones para poder ser miembro de ese de ese grupo pero lo que queremos es proyectarnos como como un mercado como un mercado eh que al fin al cabo es un mercado sumado más grande que Brasil con un ingreso per cápita Más alto que Brasil e y el la relación con con el Asia eh A través de la alianza por el Pacífico Fede una relación no solamente comercial sino geopolítica bien importante presidente lagos estuvo recientemente aquí en Colombia me decía hombre eh estúdios Cómo la alianza del del del Atlántico se se gestó aquí hay unos elementos muy parecidos aprovechen Y ustedes verán como muchos países comienzan a a interesarse eh por este grupo dentro de un contexto texto más amplio de geopolítica para tener un relacionamiento con el con el Asia Pacífico y efectivamente lo que está sucediendo países que no pertenecen al Pacífico están tratando de ingresar pequeños como Uruguay pero inclusive países europeos Italia España están queriendo participar en principio como observadores ahí hay un potencial enorme que bien manejado para Colombia puede ser algo de veras importante pero lo que quiero Resaltar en la parte internacional lo que hemos lo que hemos logrado conquistar no solamente en materia de de acuerdos comerciales sino el posicionamiento de Colombia eh los cambios que que hemos tenido en los últimos años y Y cómo el mundo percibe a Colombia es es también un factor muy importante dentro de la competitividad si es un jugador importante un jugador que tienen en cuenta que lo lo escuchan y lo oyen eso Abre puertas eso facilita muchas políticas internas Al fin y al cabo la política exterior es el reflejo de de muchas de las políticas internas que tenemos y yo diría que estamos muy bien posicionados y ese es otro de los activos que tenemos que cuidar la nueva posición que Colombia ha adquirido a nivel internacional Ahora somos jugadores importantes en el fondo monetario en el g20 inclusive nos invitaron esta en esta ocasión a participar con con toda la la autoridad y la la vocería del caso y fue de veras motivo de orgullo que en México en la última reunión del g20 varios países señalaron a Colombia como un ejemplo de un país que logró salir de una crisis y que ha logrado manejar su situación macroeconómica de forma tal que ha evitado que las crisis posteriores lo hayan afectado en forma grave y nos tuvimos la oportunidad de expresarles a los países del g20 la experiencia nuestra Cómo manej amos la crisis financiera de los de comienzos de los del año 2000 año 2000 2001 Cómo fortalecimos el el el sector financiero las regulaciones que impusimos cómo mejoramos las finanzas de las regiones de los municipios los esquemas que pusimos en marcha la famosa ley 617 y cómo eso nos permitió que la crisis del 2008 2009 prácticamente no fuéramos afectados y que hoy aunque nos está afectando la crisis pues está afectando en una forma mucho menos grave de lo que está afectando a otros países eh eso tiene su valor eso tiene eh un una importancia y eso ese posicionamiento hay que mantenerlo y cultivarlo a nivel ya más político el hecho de que Colombia haya logrado su escaño en la el Consejo de Seguridad eh que se nos Termina ahora el 31 de diciembre pero que nos permitió jugar en los grandes escenarios internacionales y jugar con con con una presencia decorosa y y y que Y respetada creo que eso es bien importante cualquier país que que mantiene ese tipo de de posicionamiento internacional pues Por supuesto que le va a representar eh crédito en sus políticas internas con Estados Unidos ustedes son testigos de las dificultades que tuvimos durante tanto tiempo hoy en día estamos en una situación privilegiada este este mes Vamos a a tener una eh una reunión de una instancia que creamos una instancia de en el tema de la seguridad de alto nivel que Estados Unidos no tiene sino con muy pocos países tiene con Gran Bretaña tiene con Corea del Sur tiene con Australia y tiene con la otá y ahora lo abrió con Colombia para hablar sobre temas de seguridad no solamente bilaterales sino regionales y vamos a ver cómo colaboramos a nivel regional Estados Unidos Colombia en Centroamérica en en el Caribe en la región en general ampliamos la agenda con Estados Unidos para salirnos simplemente de la agenda típica de lucha contra el terrorismo lucha contra el narcotráfico ahora Estamos hablando de ciencia y tecnología de Educación cooperación en el medio ambiente en muchos otros frentes hemos normalizado Por así decirlo la nuestra agenda internacional y eso dentro de la competitividad del país pues es bien importante usted mencionaba doctor David el tema que es también muy importante la justicia aquí sucedió algo pues que no es tan tan raro que suceda Pues que se concentraron todos los la atención de la opinión pública en la famosa reforma constitucional a la justicia y se eh se descuidó o no se descuidó Simplemente no se le dio importancia a las otras reformas que se estaban aprobando en el congreso en materia de Justicia que tienen un impacto mucho más importante en la competitiva del país de lo que hubiera tenido esa reforma constitucional que En buena hora se hundió por lo que sucedió a último momento pero si ustedes analizan las reformas que se aprobaron el código del proceso en la parte de de la las instancias de arbitraje tanto nacional como internacional en la otra la otra reforma que que hicimos fue el código nacional Ah el código de procedimiento que cuando uno lo analiza y el impacto que eso tiene en la agilidad de la justicia esas reformas que se que se aprobaron en forma paralela al fracaso o a la no aprobación de la Reforma constitucional mucho más importante para la competitividad del país de lo que era esa reforma constitucional estamos haciendo un gran esfuerzo lo primero que hicimos con las Cortes fue sentarnos a ver si desde el punto de vista administrativo sin necesidad de reformas constitucionales podemos mejorar eh el funcionamiento de la justicia y hemos avanzado muchísimo estamos dando unos recursos importantes nos propusimos por ejemplo eh tener más temprano que tarde el expediente virtual ir sistematizando todo lo que tiene que ver con la justicia darle acceso a los ciudadanos a la justicia por la vía del internet y eso va a facilitar enormemente ese aspecto de la competitividad en materia internacional Se me olvidaba mencionar un objetivo que nos propusimos desde el primer día del gobierno que tiene muchísimo que ver con con esto la competitividad y y fue el ingreso nuestro a la osd como ustedes me han escuchado muchas veces la ocd no es un club de países ricos es una instancia de países con las mejores prácticas que están discutiendo permanentemente eh las mejores prácticas en en muchos de los aspectos que determinan la competitividad de un país allá en la ocd estudian los mercados laborales allá en la ocd estudian el las políticas de inversión todo lo que tiene que ver realmente con la competitividad y el y un país como Colombia poder ingresar a ese a ese instancia pues es un paso enorme que nos Además nos Amarra nos obliga eh De por vida a mantener un estándar mínimo en materia de competitividad eh algo que también en cierta forma se logra con Los acuerdos eh comerciales bilaterales el acuerdo con Estados Unidos El acuerdo con Europa que debe estar debe estar siendo aprobado en en Cuándo va a ser aprobado en Bruselas el 11 de diciembre eso nos Amarra también a unos estándares mínimos de comportamiento que tiene que ver mucho con la competitividad est me da pena con ustedes pero es que hablando de la parte internacional el presidente Obama me va a hacer o nos va a hacer los colombianos un gran homenaje Y es que dentro de los cinco países que van hablar con él para felicitar quiere que el primer país latinoamericano sea Colombia y ahí está el teléfono me esperan un momentico y ya les decía la osd hemos avanzado muchísimo hemos hecho la tarea con con mucha disciplina acuérdense chile se propuso como objetivo como un objetivo de estado Catarina cuánto tiempo como 8 años eh nosotros ya tenemos ya estamos en varios comités eh eso es un proceso complejo donde lo van midiendo van midiendo al país en cada comité Cómo cumple Cómo progresa y en la medida en que ven que hay suficiente terreno conquistado entonces ahí hacen una especie de invitación formal al país para ingresar hemos avanzado muchísimo Según dice el secretario general de la de la oec Ángel gurría estamos muy bien posicionados Vamos a ver en qué momento posiblemente el próximo año nos nos inviten Si eso es así rompíamos récord porque creo que ningún país ha ingresado tan rápido en 3 años a a esta organización de todas formas ya ya el solo hecho de estar ahí en ese proceso nos obliga Y eso es lo importante a todos a mantener unos estándares en muchas de nuestras políticas por ejemplo ahí hay un un comité de lucha contra la corrupción específicamente contra el soborno ellos han visto con muy buenos ojos lo que hemos aprobado aquí con nuestro est estatuto anticorrupción eh las medidas que hemos venido tomando para evitar la corrupción los sistemas que hemos venido implantando en materia de licitaciones la transparencia de sus sistemas todo eso es sujeto a un escrutinio permanente que nos retroalimenta y nos y nos indica si estamos haciendo las cosas bien o no y y ahí hemos aprovechado eso para ir avanzando en muchos en muchos frentes por ejemplo la licitación que hicimos hace unos unos meses por 1.2 billones de pesos en materia de infraestructura la forma como se abrió esa licitación los las modalidades de de adjudicación fueron inclusive elogiadas por los perdedores es eso en instancias como la oecd es muy apreciado y además ratifican que ese es el tipo de medidas que van abonando uno el terreno para el ingreso eh a esa a esa organización e yo estoy también Totalmente de acuerdo doctor David con usted cuando dice que la madre de las locomotoras es la educación e yo yo lo llamo es uno de Los Rieles uno de Los Rieles el país que quiera sobrevivir en el mundo tiene que darle mucha importancia a la educación Ahí infortunadamente estamos atrasados estamos atrasados en la calidad hemos hecho un gran esfuerzo en aumentar la cobertura eh ustedes son conscientes pues conocen muy bien el esfuerzo que hicimos para darle eh una gratuidad eh total a los niños y niñas que vayan a los establecimientos públicos educativos públicos del grado cer al grado 11 en el esfuerzo que se está haciendo para ir mejorando eh la calidad las pruebas saber estamos tratando también de hacer unos exámenes no cada 4 5 años sino cada año o cada 2 años para ir tratando de mejorar nuestra posición en esos en esas pruebas Porque si hay algo importante en materia de competitividad frente a otros países es eso porque yo no me canso de decir que cualquier persona que se gradúe de cualquier universidad aquí en Colombia en cualquier sitio no está compitiendo solamente con con sus pares aquí en Colombia está compitiendo en el fondo en un mundo Cada vez más globalizado con sus padres en China en París en en Nueva York o en Argentina y eso es lo que tenemos que entender por eso en esa en materia de Educación tenemos que hacer un mayor esfuerzo ahí una mayor cooperación sector público y sector privado es necesaria Yo pienso que por ejemplo la la los vasos comunicantes entre las empresas y las universidades se pueden mejorar mucho se puede retroalimentar mucho más y con el propio sena Yo sé que hay y sé que se está haciendo pero ahí si hacemos un esfuerzo conjunto mayor podemos producir mejores resultados estamos comenzando a tener problemas de cuellos de botella en en muchos frentes de trabajo capacitaciones en en actividades específicas que si hubiéramos sabido que se requerían con con con más tiempo pues hubiéramos podido poner en marcha eh las los procesos de capacitación para que esos cuos de botería no se presentaran Y eso se hace Es con esos vasos comunicantes entre el sector público y el sector privado la pertinencia de la educación y la pertinencia de de la capacitación es es fundamental ahí tenemos que hacer un gran trabajo Nosotros hemos estado infortunadamente pues es un problema que lleva ya muchos años décadas eh eh descuidando desatendiendo todo lo que tiene que ver con la capacitación técnica y tecnológica en un país que que no tiene esa especie de de de instancia en materia de oferta de mano de obra bien capacitada pues va a tener dificultades en su competitividad Ahí estamos tratando de de ir corrigiendo eso eh pero es importante hacer un esfuerzo mayor eh dentro de ese esa esa concertación sector público y sector privado sobre todo anticipándose e en esto el que tiene cierta visión y se anticipa pues va a a quedar en mucho mejor posicionado para para poder competir eh hemos hecho un esfuerzo grande en en tratar de de mejorar la cobertura de de la educación superior se ha aumentado Yo diría que no es suficiente Y ahí podemos también eh hacer un esfuerzo un esfuerzo mayor se están acreditando muchas de las universidades mejorando la calidad eh Y y en eso pues cualquier cosa que se haga en materia de educación es bienvenida porque ese sí que es un aspecto importantísimo y ahí me lleva eso al a la parte de la innovación y la productividad dentro de las regalías como les hablaba la reforma ustedes conocen muy bien ese 10% que se destinó a la a la innovación a la ciencia la tecnología estamos discutiendo todavía ya se creó pues una instancia pero eso hay que irlo calibrando para ver esos recursos Cómo se invierten de la mejor forma posible mi mi intuición me dice que si podemos lograr sinergias con el sector privado eh Y y ubicar y e invertir esos recursos para obtener los mayores resultados con el sector privado sería la mejor forma de invertir esos esos recursos que no se sector privado también tiene mucha eh Muchos vasos comunicantes con el tipo de investigación que se puede hacer no solamente para mejorar la productividad en el sector privado sino para ir descubriendo y ampliando fronteras dentro de nuestro propio país e Este es un Este es un un mundo donde nosotros tenemos un gran potencial pero que infortunadamente no hemos desarrollado las destrezas apropiadas hasta ahora Estamos dándole la importancia eh el porcentaje de recursos que el país le ha invertido a las ciencia tecnología son mínimos frente a las necesidades y ahí es ahí hay un área donde si no hacemos lo lo lo correcto Pues nos vamos a quedar retrasados de por vida Por qué es tan importante la innovación y y Por qué es tan importante esa investigación porque para qué quiere ser uno competitivo pues para poder producir más para poder crecer más el crecimiento digamos es una condición necesaria para poder para poder generar el bienestar el empleo eh los las variables con que mide uno el éxito de una economía nosotros queremos montarnos en eh la senda del crecimiento positivo alto y de largo plazo pero cuando uno hace un análisis de cómo Cuáles son las fuentes de ese crecimiento y cuál han sido las fuentes del de crecimiento de los países que han logrado crecer a tasas altas durante mucho tiempo descubre uno que los factores tradicionales que han sido los factores de crecimiento de Colombia nuestros recursos naturales la minería el petróleo la industria los factores tradicionales explican un porcentaje de ese crecimiento el el resto lo explica Un aumento en productividad que se da por por aspectos como la innovación por eso es tan importante repito Si queremos tener una economía con un crecimiento relativamente alto y sostenido en el tiempo es absolutamente indispensable que podamos internalizar lo la necesidad de innovar permanentemente y que el componente de mayor productividad se convierta en un componente que explique por lo menos diría yo un 2% 25% del crecimiento de otra forma no vamos a poder sostener porque los recursos naturales son finitos no podemos seguir creciendo simplemente a punta de de de exportaciones de Carbón eso eso no es un crecimiento sostenible en largo plazo entre otas cosas el carbón bajado de precio en los últimos meses de 120,75 nadie se preveía eso por qué sucedió eso Simplemente porque Estados Unidos descubrió un sistema para para producir más gas y entonces en lugar de volverse de continuar como importador de Carbón ahora Estados Unidos está exportando carbón y le está exportando a nuestro mercado tradicional que es Europa entonces son factores que están por fuera de nuestro de nuestra digamos capacidad de dominarlos y por eso Si queremos ser sostenibles en largo plazo ese aspecto de la innovación la tecnología es tan importante y eso es una cultura que infortunadamente nosotros la Hemos descuidado hasta ahora la estamos la estamos eh asimilando Esa fue la razón por la cual además en en nuestro último viaje a China paramos en Singapur porque los campeones de la innovación los que realmente han logrado posicionarse como innovadores natos son eh son las empresas en Singapur el gobierno y empresas y quisimos parar allá y pedirle al al Primer Ministro de Singapur que solamente nos ayude en eso que nos ayuda a capacitar y a internalizar y a poder asimilar los procesos y las instancias y las instituciones que fomenten ese ese esa palabra mágica que se ha vuelto tan importante que es la innovación dentro de eso la innovación pues está también la utilización de las tecnologías que uno puede ahorrarse varios pasos como un atajo eh en materia de Educación si uno logra una correcta aplicación de la tecnología pues puede acelerar eh el incremento el mejoramiento de la calidad de Educación y en una forma importante de ahí el objetivo que tenemos que nos propusimos de desde el primer día de conectar la mayor cantidad de hogares al internet y sobre todo de darle a los a los estatos más bajos acceso a esa tecnología ustedes ven que por ejemplo en estas las 100,000 casas que vamos a darle los más pobres de los pobres todas esas casas van a tener conexión a internet y todas esas casas van a tener un subsidio de 300,000 pesos para que compren un computador eh Y estamos y aquí el sector privado puede colaborar mucho eh buscando todas las mejores formas para que las aplicaciones pasado para que Cómo se utiliza esa tecnología tenga un impacto En aquellos factores de competitividad sobre todo en materia de Educación estamos abriendo lo que llamamos los puntos vive digital por todo el país estuve el sábado pasado el último que abrimos fue en Valle dupar esos muchachos esos niños que por primera primera vez tienen acceso a esa tecnología la capacidad y la rapidez con que asimilan eso Si uno encausa esa capacidad tecnológica en materia de Educación y cada punto de esos video digital tiene unas pantallas de la con la última tecnología para enseñarle a los niños con las pantallas electrónicas todo tipo de capacidades por ejemplo en materia de matemáticas y y de lenguas Y eso ahí hay una oportunidad de dar un brinco importante en materia de calidad ahí hemos avanzado bastante 2.2 millones de hogares estan conectados ya lamos como 5.8 5.9 esperamos terminar el cuatrenio con 8.8 millones que son casi el 50% y los colegios todos los colegios estamos dando computadores estamos fando el uso de la tecnología dónde hemos encontrado algunas dificultades hemos encontrado unos unos docentes muy entusiasmados muy muy comprometidos pero otros que que dicen no pues a mí me queda 5 años y me voy a jubilar Yo que voy a ponerme a aprender de computadores a estas alturas Y si los docentes no se entusiasman con eso el esfuerzo se puede se puede trancar ahí también podemos podríamos hacer un esfuerzo conjunto de estimular a a a los docentes y y ver cómo podemos internalizar también ese uso de la de la tecnología de la mejor forma posible porque eso repito nos va a permitir eh Elevar la calidad de la educación Y lograr los objetivos en materia de competitividad mucho más rápido que por los caminos tradicionales y eso la de la tecnología y la innovación casi que están eh Como casados está Son son dos dos conceptos que se se entrelazan el uno con el otro el acceso a la tecnología en cierta forma eh facilita la innovación y viceversa y por eso esos dos aspectos son tan importantes eh hemos eh hecho bueno el uno de los factores que ustedes saben perfectamente que Colombia ha estado muy atrasado eh en en materia de competitividad pues es nuestra infraestructura las quejas vienen desde la época en que abrimos la economía cómo nos va a poner a competir con x o y país y si un contenedor que sale de Bogotá a Buenaventura pues cuesta el triple de lo que puede costar de Buenaventura a Hong Kong y ese ha sido un cuello de bía enorme ahí también hemos hecho un esfuerzo que visto desde el punto de vista de del Progreso que se está logrando es un esfuerzo realmente importante solamente para darles un orden de magnitudes nosotros invertí más o menos el 1% del pib cerca de 3 billones de pesos en infraestructura por año eh decidimos cambiar eso fundamentalmente nos propusimos Buscar los mecanismos de poder hacerlo preservando las limitaciones Fiscales y preservando los objetivos Fiscales de llegar a equilibrio fiscal el año entrante y encontramos los mecanismos a través de la ley de Apps que aprobamos en el congreso y nos propusimos mejorar la institucional idad y nos propusimos también mejorar la forma de estructurar los proyectos y de adjudicar los proyectos y hoy tenemos ya en marcha unas unos proyectos que hace unos años creo que nadie se podía imaginar que íbamos a poder lograr poner a funcionar estuve hace dos días en un sitio de de control de la de la carretera Bogotá y villavicencio es que es un desastre un desastre porque no se previó el aumento del tráfico pero cuando ve uno las especificaciones de lo que se está construyendo e en materia de cosas tan simples pero tan importantes como las pendientes o la curvatura eh los túneles los viaductos Pues estamos construyendo comenzando a construir realmente de autopistas que no tienen nada que enviarle a las autopistas en Italia o en Suiza o en Alemania son autopistas realmente de Gran envergadura lo que se está haciendo en las autopistas eh de la prosperidad allá en en Antioquia las especificaciones son eh autopistas de estándares absolutamente internacionales que no tienen que enviarle a ningún otro país a tal punto que tenemos en materia de para el contexto esto de la comparación 3 billones que era lo que lo que invertí 6 billones invertimos el año pasado pero lo que vamos a hacer hacia hacia adelante este año y y lo que viene son si sumamos lo que vamos a entregar en concesiones más las propuestas que hemos recibido de Apps suman 58 59 billones de pesos fíjense lo que eso significa de una inversión de 3 billones a una inversión de casi 60 o sea eh 20 veces más eso yo espero que en unos años pues podamos ver realmente Una Revolución un país diferente un país diferente donde efectivamente un contenedor de Bogotá a Buenaventura eh En lugar de costar $3000 pues cueste 1000 y podamos ser competitivos eh e ahí Creo que el El Progreso que estamos haciendo es bien importante no sin dificultades eh ustedes son testigos y son son eh además víctimas Pues de el tema de las licencias el tema de las comunidades el tema de de de las eh eh de las eh expropiaciones de los terrenos y todos los litigios que hay ahora nació uno nuevo en creíamos que teníamos ya todo solucionado para para la vía a Buenaventura la corte acaba de darle a una comunidad una tutela que suspende nuevamente una una una obra que estamos haciendo allá porque esa comunidad es que no se había incluido en la consulta todo eso pues son son temas que hay que ir resolviendo y que estamos con todo el propósito de resolverlo eh que son dificultades eh que se presentan pero que son superables en fin ya me estoy alargando más de la de la cuenta lo que quiero es decirles que el contexto general de del país en este momento el el el ambiente Macro eh el ambiente económico internacional en comparación con el con lo que estamos haciendo aquí en Colombia todo eso influye muchísimo en la competitividad del país y ya los los aspectos puntuales del informe que ustedes están presentando Pues el gobierno está más que dispuesto a sentarse a irlo arreglando uno por uno e yo hablaba con el presidente de Chile en Chile tienen una persona no un grupo de personas dedicadas exclusivamente y solamente al a los indicadores de competitividad alimentar es es algo que podíamos hacer nosotros doctor Sergio alimentar a los a las instancias que publican esas esas esos índices de competitividad Yo tuve la oportunidad como les decía al principio con y con Je analizar el primer la primera participación nuestra en materia de competitividad eso lo han venido digamos cambiando mejorando lo del World Forum es una cuestión de percepción y F con esto termino si tuviéramos una mayor comunicación con el podríamos a veces corregir algunas calificaciones negativas si damos más información objetiva porque no es que vamos a dar información que no sea real acabamos de de hacer el estudio más completo que se ha hecho en el país en materia de victimización qué descubrimos que nosotros somos bastante masoquistas en materia de seguridad por digo que bastante masoquistas lo digo yo como antiguo periodista le damos el tema de la seguridad por supuesto producto de la violencia que hemos vivido no eso no es inventado Eso es Es real si ha habido un país que ha que ha sufrido la violencia y ha sufrido en seguridad pues ha sido Colombia pero la mejora en seguridad eh No se ha traducido en la mejora de percepción de seguridad eh Y esa ese estudio de victimización lo lo prueba ya con cifras en términos generales las ciudades colombianas no tienen una victimización mayor al promedio de las ciudades en el resto del mundo estamos más o menos dentro del promedio promedio es más o menos el 20% de la gente que fue consultada que fueron más de 178000 personas fue en los últimos dos meses víctima de algún tipo de delito de algún tipo ese promedio es parecido al promedio de muchas ciudades pero pero cuando les pregunta uno usted se siente inseguro de ese 20% sube a 61 O sea que la percepción de inseguridad frente a la realidad de victimización hay un una una instancia enorme Entonces si hay un problema y ahí lo comprueba de percepción no queremos decir que estemos viviendo un paraíso Tenemos muchos problemas en algunas zonas los problemas se han agravado pero pero en términos generales nosotros nos encargamos nosotros mismo nos encargamos de alimentar la percepción de inseguridad que por lo menos no guarda ninguna relación con la realidad en materia de victimización si uno ve el World economic Forum dónde estamos en materia de seguridad la percepción Pues nos coloca en los últimos lugares entonces ahí hay un un tema doctor Sergio como de mejorar nuestra lo que hace chile mejorar la comunicación con esas instancias para darles la información más Ob eh Y ahí podemos seguir mejorando De todas formas este proceso de de de ser más competitivos pues es un proceso como les decía al principio de mejoramiento continuo permanente todos los países en una u otra forma están haciendo lo mismo que nosotros todas las empresas ustedes lo saben mejor que que yo están haciendo lo mismo cómo somos más competitivos para llegar al al mercado con un producto de mejor calidad con un producto más barato en los países hacen mismo eso es lo que tenemos que estar revisando permanentemente por eso esta instancia instancias como estas son tan importantes y repito eh la concertación sector público y sector privado eh es fundamental nosotros como país estamos compitiendo frente a otros países no estamos compitiendo entre nosotros tenemos que ayudarnos mutuamente para ser más competitivos eh Y por parte del gobierno lo único que van a recibir Ustedes es puertas abiertas y voluntad de ayudar a mejorar la competitividad de todos y cada uno de ustedes eh Por algo también muy sencillo si a ustedes les va bien al gobierno también les va le va mejor eh estamos en la misma Barca y remando en la misma dirección Muchas gracias"

They didn’t get there by managing every little detail themselves. They built a system that lets them focus on the big picture while their channels are run by the best YouTube automation tools. ‍ So, I decided to figure out how to use AI to run my YouTube channel on autopilot. Here’s what you need to do: What is YouTube Automation? In simple terms, YouTube automation is a process where content creators streamline or even outsource parts of their video-making process to save time and boost productivity. In simple terms, it means using tools or services to handle repetitive tasks—like video editing, keyword research, thumbnail creation, or even video scripts—so the creator can focus more on strategy and growth. ‍ Imagine you want to run a YouTube channel without doing everything yourself. ‍ With YouTube automation, you might hire a scriptwriter, use an AI tool to edit videos, or automate your social media posting for each new upload. ‍ Some creators even build whole channels without appearing on camera by using voiceovers and stock footage. ‍ Dave Nick, a YouTuber with 934,000 subscribers, explains: “YouTube automation is taking a business approach to YouTube. ‍ Instead of being the face of the channel, recording videos, and editing them yourself, you create faceless content that earns revenue from ads, sponsorships, and digital products. ‍ You don’t need to be on camera, edit videos, or even be involved in the creation process at all. ‍ To automate a YouTube channel, you have two options Use AI tools to handle everything Outsource the work and simply steer the ship Today, I’m going to guide you through the first option—using AI tools to run a successful YouTube channel without breaking the bank on outsourcing. ‍ Let’s jump right in! Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up YouTube Automation Starting with YouTube automation can feel overwhelming. But you don’t need to overthink it. Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be on your way to a successful YouTube channel. Choose the Right Niche When picking a YouTube niche, don’t just chase ad revenue. You need millions of views to make serious money, unless you’re in a high-traffic niche like MrBeast’s. Relying on YouTube’s algorithm is risky. ‍ Instead, I want control over my channel, so I can cash in whenever I want. If YouTube changes its algorithm, I’m still in charge, leveraging my audience and content for new opportunities. ‍ Take my example: I chose the business and marketing niche because it offers: High CPM: Up to $13.52 per 1,000 views, according to TubeBuddy, by focusing on topics like making money online and digital marketing. Multiple Revenue Streams: Brand sponsorships, freelance opportunities, and even courses on marketing and business. Professional Alignment: It sharpens my professional skills and improves my profile. Not sure about your niche? Ask yourself: Am I passionate about this niche? Can this niche provide multiple income streams beyond ads? Do I have enough knowledge in this niche to create valuable content? If you’re curious about different niches, take a look at the video below! Choosing a niche you enjoy with long-term potential is key to staying motivated. YouTube can take 2-3 years to gain traction, so avoiding burnout is crucial. ‍ MrBeast spent 10 years in his niche before going viral. ‍ Still can’t define yours? ‍ Then… ‍ Start creating, experiment, and you’ll find it. ‍ Did I choose \"marketing and business\" when I first started out? ‍ Nope! ‍ I tried different jobs, created content for other businesses, and managed multiple channels of my own. ‍ I kept planning, testing, and creating until I found the niche that aligned with my passion, what I do well, and what the market pays for. ‍ That’s how I stayed motivated until my channel finally took off. Create Content Ideas Now that you've chosen your niche, most will tell you to start with the channel name, but I suggest a different approach. First, think about the main topics you want to cover. ‍ For example, if your niche is business and marketing like mine, break it down into 5 key topics: How to Make Money Online: Explore side hustles, new business models, and remote jobs. Marketing Strategies: Share tips on marketing and how to monetize those skills. Freelancing Tips: Offer advice on excelling as a freelancer and reaching the top of your field. Investing on a Budget: Teach how to start investing with little money and grow wealth over time. Business Success Stories: Highlight business journeys, including challenges and wins. These topics will provide value, keep you motivated, and help you grow as an expert. ‍ As your channel grows, you can start monetizing early by offering services like YouTube consulting or selling digital products, such as business guides or Notion templates. ‍ The reason I list out 5 topics for my channel is to avoid burnout. Many content creators struggle with whether to niche down or niche up. ‍ For me, it’s all about balance. Niche down for laser focus and growth in the beginning, then niche up within that area to keep learning and creating without losing interest. Craft Content Plan Once you have your core 5 topics, the next step is developing a content plan. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm content ideas, hashtags, and keywords for a month, three months, or even a year. This will give you a roadmap, so you’re never stuck wondering what content to create next. ‍ You can use the following prompt for ChatGPT: ‍ “I need help developing a content strategy for my brand in the [niche]. My main platform is YouTube. I need you to develop content ideas specifically for YouTube. For example, I’m in the business and marketing niche, and I’ve created a video titled, '6 Ways to Earn Money Online for People with No Experience!' That’s the type of content I want. Create [Number] content ideas for YouTube. Generate [necessary information] like titles, outlines, and ideas that stand out in my niche.” ‍ For example: ‍ \"I need help developing a content strategy for my business and marketing brand. I use YouTube as my main platform and need 10 content ideas with video outlines and titles. Make these ideas relevant and competitive.” After ChatGPT generates a list of ideas, do some competitive research. ‍ Look at successful videos in your niche and note their titles. This ensures ChatGPT’s ideas align with content that’s proven to perform well on YouTube. Finding that balance between creativity and what works is key! ‍ Now that you have your niche, strategy, monetization plan, and content roadmap, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and bring your plan to life. Let's move on to the execution phase! Set Up Your Channel Simply create a Google account and pick a name for your YouTube channel. ‍ Then, upload a profile picture and banner that align with your niche and content focus. You can easily customize a template you like using Canva. And just like that, you're ready to roll! ‍ For example, if your channel is about marketing, you might use a name like \"JennyMarketing.\" Pair this with a professional banner and a clear, concise description of what your channel offers. How to create content With your list of content ideas in hand, you're ready to start making videos. ‍ But it's easier said than done. Long-time YouTuber MatPat retired in 2021, citing burnout from over a decade of nonstop content creation. ‍ Many veteran creators feel similar pressures ​(Creator Handbook). ‍ Creating videos means you have to write a script, edit footage, add a voiceover, sprinkle in some sound effects, and find the right music. ‍ It’s a time suck, and if you're not experienced, it can take weeks just to produce one video. ‍ I don’t want that tedious process to crush your dream, so here’s my secret to keeping your motivation sky-high and seeing results within the first few months. ‍ Creating a faceless YouTube video boils down to five key ingredients: Script Voice-over Visuals Music Captions Image source Script Writing a full script isn’t just time-consuming; it’s also tricky if you don’t have much writing experience. But with Zebracat, you just need to drop your content idea into the platform, and Zebracat will generate a script for you. You’ll even get three scripts to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits best, tweak it, or add your own touch. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from text in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video. They don't want to read—they want to watch, feel, and engage. In just 60 seconds, Zebracat transforms your text into fully edited videos that get your audience hooked. No editing skills required! Your browser does not support the video tag. Try Zebracat for Free ‍ If you want to try creating a script with ChatGPT instead, use this prompt: ‍ \"Your task will be to write my short script for my short video on YouTube. First read these scripts I wrote. Tell me how I write and create a style guide to use in the new script. Make the style guide include what kind of words I use, my sentence length, my tone and style and structure. Include what makes my writing unique [Include example posts]” ‍ After that, chatGPT will give you this result: Once ChatGPT analyzes your style and gives you a guide, you can start feeding it content ideas or drafts. From there, ChatGPT will craft an engaging script that matches the style and tone you’ve provided, making the script feel like your own. ‍ And if you’re curious about the other AI tools I use to create viral scripts that still feel human—without spending hours—check out Best AI Apps for Content Creators in 2025. Voice-over If you are the person who: Not confident with your voice Keep stumbling over words and re-recording again and again. Feel like recording eats up too much time and kills your creativity. Then, try a more efficient method: ‍ Just pick one of Zebracat’s 100+ human-sounding voices in a variety of languages. ‍ It’ll make your videos sound more professional and engaging, helping them stand out. With this option, you can focus less on creating content yourself and stop worrying about why your YouTube Shorts aren’t getting views anymore ‍ You can try other text-to-voice tools like ElevenLabs, Murf, or Speechify, but I highly recommend using Zebracat’s built-in voice-over feature. ‍ It helps you create videos much faster since you don’t have to switch between different apps or pay multiple subscriptions. Plus, you can test the voice-over quality right in Zebracat to see if it suits your needs. ‍ Visuals Do you enjoy spending hours editing a 1-minute video? ‍ Searching through endless footage, stock images, downloading music from different platforms, and stressing about copyright issues—only for your laptop to slow down when you try to piece it all together? ‍ I HATE it. But you don’t need to bear that tedious part of creating content. ‍ You just need to type in or paste scripts in Zebracat and it will automatically create the best footage and images for your content, saving you from the hassle of searching, cutting, stitching clips, animating elements—whatever it is. It handles all of that for you. Music Have you ever seen how YouTubers spend hours searching for the perfect music to match their content? Image Source Just thinking about it is already exhausting. I hate scrolling through endless lists of songs, trying to find one that fits, listening over and over until it finally matches my video. ‍ It’s such a painful process, especially when you’re on a tight schedule. ‍ 90% of content creators report experiencing burnout, with 71% saying it made them consider quitting entirely. ‍ Efficient social media tools help automate repetitive tasks and alleviate the mental load of constant content creation ​(Tubefilter). ‍ That’s why I use the music in Zebracat. No more searching, downloading, organizing, or trying to remember where I saved the files. ‍ You just click “Music,” and Zebracat has everything organized by genre. You can find the right track instantly, with no worries about copyright issues. Super easy! Captions If you want animated pop-up captions, there’s no need to use any extra tools. ‍ Just use Zebracat!

Optimize Videos for SEO Yay! You’ve made awesome content, but just posting isn’t enough. You need to make it SEO-friendly if you want your video to blow up: Use a title with keywords people search for. You don’t want it lost in the crowd! Add trending hashtags. They help the algorithm know what your video is about. Make a thumbnail that grabs attention and makes people want to click. Use video chapters so viewers can easily follow along. To automate all of this, you can use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ. Personally, I use TubeBuddy because it’s super affordable—just $2.50/month, or around $1.80/month with a discount code if you pay yearly. ‍ TubeBuddy helps you save keywords when researching your competitors and keeps track of your content ideas. ‍ When you add their plugin and watch any YouTube video, it shows you metrics like the channel’s SEO score, hashtags, and keywords used in the title and description. ‍ You can also save competitors' hashtags directly to your TubeBuddy account and easily add them to your videos. No more manually checking lists or files—just pick the hashtag file you want, and your content is instantly SEO optimized. Image Source ‍ And if you're unsure what keywords or title to use for your next video, just search in TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer. ‍ It ranks keywords from most to least searched and links you to competitor videos. It’s super efficient. You can see which content from your competitors ranks for each keyword and which videos have the most views, all in the dashboard! With all of these tools, you can already automate your YouTube channel right now! But if you’re curious about what other tools can help you grow your YouTube automation channel, check out “Best AI Tools to Create Faceless Videos in 2025.” ‍ Best Practices and Tips for Effective Automation Automated content creation can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. It’s tempting to want all the benefits right away, but trust me, taking it step by step will save you from headaches. Start Small and Scale When I first started using automation, I wanted to fix everything at once—scheduling, editing, SEO, all of it. But it felt like trying to clean an entire messy house in one hour. I ended up frustrated and back where I started. ‍ The better way? Tackle one room at a time. Start with the thing that’s draining your energy the most. For me, it was editing. So, I used Zebracat to create videos faster without getting stuck in the tiny details. Once that was under control, I moved on to SEO and started using TubeBuddy for tags and titles. ‍ This way, I could actually see progress. And honestly? Seeing that one part of my process was smoother gave me the motivation to keep going. ‍ You don’t need to automate everything right away. Pick one small thing, make it work, and then build from there. ‍ Take it slow, and you’ll feel the difference. Bit by bit, your channel will run smoother, and you’ll get back the time you thought you’d lost forever. Regularly Check Automated Processes Even the most reliable systems need regular check-ups. ‍ Think of your best YouTube automation tools as a well-tended garden; without consistent care, weeds can overtake the beauty. Regularly reviewing your automated processes ensures they align with your channel's goals and adapt to any changes. ‍ For example, if you've automated video uploads or SEO tasks, periodically assess whether the metadata generated remains relevant. ‍ Trends evolve, and outdated tags or descriptions can negatively impact your visibility. Tools like VidIQ can alert you to shifts in your niche, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. Balance Automation with Human Touch YouTube workflow automation is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your unique voice and creativity. Viewers connect with authentic content. ‍ While platforms like Zebracat can streamline video creation, adding personal elements—such as responding to comments or hosting live Q&A sessions—keeps your audience engaged. ‍ Brands combining automation with human interaction saw higher engagement rates than those relying solely on automation. Use automation to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities that require your personal touch. ‍ \"Automation is great for the grunt work,\" I often say, \"but the heart of your channel—the connection with your audience—should always come from you.\" Maintain Consistency with Branding Think about your best friend. They’ve got their signature style—maybe it’s a favorite hoodie or those worn-out sneakers they always wear. ‍ Then one day, they show up in a sharp suit and fancy shoes. You’d stop and stare, right? Not because they look bad, but because it doesn’t feel like them. ‍ That’s exactly how your audience feels when your branding suddenly changes. If your thumbnails, fonts, or tone aren’t consistent, it throws them off. It feels like they’ve landed on someone else’s channel, and that trust you’ve built starts to fade. ‍ Automation can help you keep things steady. Tools like Zebracat make it easy to create templates for intros and outros that match your style every time. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so your audience always knows it’s you. Track and Adjust Based on Analytics Automation without checking your numbers is like driving with your eyes closed—you might be moving, but you have no idea where you’re going. Take time to look at your channel’s performance. Tools like YouTube Studio show you what’s working, like how long people watch your videos or how often they click on your thumbnails. If some videos don’t click with your audience, tweak your approach and create more of what they love. FAQs ‍ How Does Automation Affect YouTube Channel Engagement? Picture this: You’re throwing a party. You’d want everyone to feel welcome, right? Automation can help with stuff like managing the guest list or sending reminders, but if it’s overdone, people might feel like they’re just another name on a list. ‍ Same deal with YouTube—automation can make posting videos and handling comments easier, but too much can make your channel feel... kinda impersonal. People want to feel like there’s a real person behind the screen. If your replies seem automated, viewers might not stick around because they don’t feel valued. What Are the Risks of Automating YouTube Content? Automation’s a time saver, but it’s not perfect. Think of it like a double-edged sword. ‍ On one side, it helps you get things done faster, but on the other, it can mess things up if you’re not careful. For example, you might accidentally post something irrelevant or poorly timed if you’re not watching closely. ‍ Overdoing automation can also make your channel feel robotic—like sending a pre-printed birthday card instead of a handwritten one. It’s just... meh. People come to YouTube for the personal vibe, so don’t lose that! How Can I Automate Responses to Comments on YouTube? Automating responses is like having a helpful friend at your party who greets people and answers basic questions. Tools like YouTube’s moderation features or bots can handle stuff like “Thanks for watching!” or FAQs. ‍ But here’s the thing: not every comment should get an automated reply. Sprinkle in some real responses to—it shows your viewers you’re paying attention and that they matter. A mix of both works best! Is It Possible to Automate Live Streams on YouTube? You can totally automate parts of your live streams!. Tools like OBS Studio or Streamlabs can help schedule streams or set up graphics automatically. But here’s the kicker: live streams are all about interacting with your audience in real time. So, while you can automate the setup, you still need to be there, chatting and connecting with your viewers. That’s what makes live streams awesome. Can I Automate Ad Placement in My YouTube Videos? Yes, you can. You don’t have to do anything—YouTube already places ads automatically on your videos. ‍ However, if you want to control what types of ads appear, how many should show up, where they should appear, and when they should play, you’ll need to set it up yourself or hire a virtual assistant to do it for you. ‍ This process can be quite time-consuming, and so far, there aren’t any tools to automate this. But I’ll keep you updated if anything changes! ‍ But don’t go overboard with ads. Too many can annoy viewers and make them click away. Keep a balance—ads should work with your content, not ruin the vibe. ‍ Conclusion While AI can automate your YouTube channel entirely, I still recommend keeping an eye on it to maintain authenticity. ‍ AI is powerful and has a lot of potential, but it's still in its early stages and can’t fully replace you. Don’t ignore your content completely. The best way to grow long-term is to create a lot of worthwhile videos with Zebracat and keep monitoring your channels to bring your channel to the next level. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from blog post in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.

They didn’t get there by managing every little detail themselves. They built a system that lets them focus on the big picture while their channels are run by the best YouTube automation tools. ‍ So, I decided to figure out how to use AI to run my YouTube channel on autopilot. Here’s what you need to do: What is YouTube Automation? In simple terms, YouTube automation is a process where content creators streamline or even outsource parts of their video-making process to save time and boost productivity. In simple terms, it means using tools or services to handle repetitive tasks—like video editing, keyword research, thumbnail creation, or even video scripts—so the creator can focus more on strategy and growth. ‍ Imagine you want to run a YouTube channel without doing everything yourself. ‍ With YouTube automation, you might hire a scriptwriter, use an AI tool to edit videos, or automate your social media posting for each new upload. ‍ Some creators even build whole channels without appearing on camera by using voiceovers and stock footage. ‍ Dave Nick, a YouTuber with 934,000 subscribers, explains: “YouTube automation is taking a business approach to YouTube. ‍ Instead of being the face of the channel, recording videos, and editing them yourself, you create faceless content that earns revenue from ads, sponsorships, and digital products. ‍ You don’t need to be on camera, edit videos, or even be involved in the creation process at all. ‍ To automate a YouTube channel, you have two options Use AI tools to handle everything Outsource the work and simply steer the ship Today, I’m going to guide you through the first option—using AI tools to run a successful YouTube channel without breaking the bank on outsourcing. ‍ Let’s jump right in! Step-by-Step Guide to Setting Up YouTube Automation Starting with YouTube automation can feel overwhelming. But you don’t need to overthink it. Just follow the steps below, and you’ll be on your way to a successful YouTube channel. Choose the Right Niche When picking a YouTube niche, don’t just chase ad revenue. You need millions of views to make serious money, unless you’re in a high-traffic niche like MrBeast’s. Relying on YouTube’s algorithm is risky. ‍ Instead, I want control over my channel, so I can cash in whenever I want. If YouTube changes its algorithm, I’m still in charge, leveraging my audience and content for new opportunities. ‍ Take my example: I chose the business and marketing niche because it offers: High CPM: Up to $13.52 per 1,000 views, according to TubeBuddy, by focusing on topics like making money online and digital marketing. Multiple Revenue Streams: Brand sponsorships, freelance opportunities, and even courses on marketing and business. Professional Alignment: It sharpens my professional skills and improves my profile. Not sure about your niche? Ask yourself: Am I passionate about this niche? Can this niche provide multiple income streams beyond ads? Do I have enough knowledge in this niche to create valuable content? If you’re curious about different niches, take a look at the video below! Choosing a niche you enjoy with long-term potential is key to staying motivated. YouTube can take 2-3 years to gain traction, so avoiding burnout is crucial. ‍ MrBeast spent 10 years in his niche before going viral. ‍ Still can’t define yours? ‍ Then… ‍ Start creating, experiment, and you’ll find it. ‍ Did I choose \"marketing and business\" when I first started out? ‍ Nope! ‍ I tried different jobs, created content for other businesses, and managed multiple channels of my own. ‍ I kept planning, testing, and creating until I found the niche that aligned with my passion, what I do well, and what the market pays for. ‍ That’s how I stayed motivated until my channel finally took off. Create Content Ideas Now that you've chosen your niche, most will tell you to start with the channel name, but I suggest a different approach. First, think about the main topics you want to cover. ‍ For example, if your niche is business and marketing like mine, break it down into 5 key topics: How to Make Money Online: Explore side hustles, new business models, and remote jobs. Marketing Strategies: Share tips on marketing and how to monetize those skills. Freelancing Tips: Offer advice on excelling as a freelancer and reaching the top of your field. Investing on a Budget: Teach how to start investing with little money and grow wealth over time. Business Success Stories: Highlight business journeys, including challenges and wins. These topics will provide value, keep you motivated, and help you grow as an expert. ‍ As your channel grows, you can start monetizing early by offering services like YouTube consulting or selling digital products, such as business guides or Notion templates. ‍ The reason I list out 5 topics for my channel is to avoid burnout. Many content creators struggle with whether to niche down or niche up. ‍ For me, it’s all about balance. Niche down for laser focus and growth in the beginning, then niche up within that area to keep learning and creating without losing interest. Craft Content Plan Once you have your core 5 topics, the next step is developing a content plan. Use ChatGPT to brainstorm content ideas, hashtags, and keywords for a month, three months, or even a year. This will give you a roadmap, so you’re never stuck wondering what content to create next. ‍ You can use the following prompt for ChatGPT: ‍ “I need help developing a content strategy for my brand in the [niche]. My main platform is YouTube. I need you to develop content ideas specifically for YouTube. For example, I’m in the business and marketing niche, and I’ve created a video titled, '6 Ways to Earn Money Online for People with No Experience!' That’s the type of content I want. Create [Number] content ideas for YouTube. Generate [necessary information] like titles, outlines, and ideas that stand out in my niche.” ‍ For example: ‍ \"I need help developing a content strategy for my business and marketing brand. I use YouTube as my main platform and need 10 content ideas with video outlines and titles. Make these ideas relevant and competitive.” After ChatGPT generates a list of ideas, do some competitive research. ‍ Look at successful videos in your niche and note their titles. This ensures ChatGPT’s ideas align with content that’s proven to perform well on YouTube. Finding that balance between creativity and what works is key! ‍ Now that you have your niche, strategy, monetization plan, and content roadmap, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and bring your plan to life. Let's move on to the execution phase! Set Up Your Channel Simply create a Google account and pick a name for your YouTube channel. ‍ Then, upload a profile picture and banner that align with your niche and content focus. You can easily customize a template you like using Canva. And just like that, you're ready to roll! ‍ For example, if your channel is about marketing, you might use a name like \"JennyMarketing.\" Pair this with a professional banner and a clear, concise description of what your channel offers. How to create content With your list of content ideas in hand, you're ready to start making videos. ‍ But it's easier said than done. Long-time YouTuber MatPat retired in 2021, citing burnout from over a decade of nonstop content creation. ‍ Many veteran creators feel similar pressures ​(Creator Handbook). ‍ Creating videos means you have to write a script, edit footage, add a voiceover, sprinkle in some sound effects, and find the right music. ‍ It’s a time suck, and if you're not experienced, it can take weeks just to produce one video. ‍ I don’t want that tedious process to crush your dream, so here’s my secret to keeping your motivation sky-high and seeing results within the first few months. ‍ Creating a faceless YouTube video boils down to five key ingredients: Script Voice-over Visuals Music Captions Image source Script Writing a full script isn’t just time-consuming; it’s also tricky if you don’t have much writing experience. But with Zebracat, you just need to drop your content idea into the platform, and Zebracat will generate a script for you. You’ll even get three scripts to choose from, so you can pick the one that fits best, tweak it, or add your own touch. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from text in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video. They don't want to read—they want to watch, feel, and engage. In just 60 seconds, Zebracat transforms your text into fully edited videos that get your audience hooked. No editing skills required! Your browser does not support the video tag. Try Zebracat for Free ‍ If you want to try creating a script with ChatGPT instead, use this prompt: ‍ \"Your task will be to write my short script for my short video on YouTube. First read these scripts I wrote. Tell me how I write and create a style guide to use in the new script. Make the style guide include what kind of words I use, my sentence length, my tone and style and structure. Include what makes my writing unique [Include example posts]” ‍ After that, chatGPT will give you this result: Once ChatGPT analyzes your style and gives you a guide, you can start feeding it content ideas or drafts. From there, ChatGPT will craft an engaging script that matches the style and tone you’ve provided, making the script feel like your own. ‍ And if you’re curious about the other AI tools I use to create viral scripts that still feel human—without spending hours—check out Best AI Apps for Content Creators in 2025. Voice-over If you are the person who: Not confident with your voice Keep stumbling over words and re-recording again and again. Feel like recording eats up too much time and kills your creativity. Then, try a more efficient method: ‍ Just pick one of Zebracat’s 100+ human-sounding voices in a variety of languages. ‍ It’ll make your videos sound more professional and engaging, helping them stand out. With this option, you can focus less on creating content yourself and stop worrying about why your YouTube Shorts aren’t getting views anymore ‍ You can try other text-to-voice tools like ElevenLabs, Murf, or Speechify, but I highly recommend using Zebracat’s built-in voice-over feature. ‍ It helps you create videos much faster since you don’t have to switch between different apps or pay multiple subscriptions. Plus, you can test the voice-over quality right in Zebracat to see if it suits your needs. ‍ Visuals Do you enjoy spending hours editing a 1-minute video? ‍ Searching through endless footage, stock images, downloading music from different platforms, and stressing about copyright issues—only for your laptop to slow down when you try to piece it all together? ‍ I HATE it. But you don’t need to bear that tedious part of creating content. ‍ You just need to type in or paste scripts in Zebracat and it will automatically create the best footage and images for your content, saving you from the hassle of searching, cutting, stitching clips, animating elements—whatever it is. It handles all of that for you. Music Have you ever seen how YouTubers spend hours searching for the perfect music to match their content? Image Source Just thinking about it is already exhausting. I hate scrolling through endless lists of songs, trying to find one that fits, listening over and over until it finally matches my video. ‍ It’s such a painful process, especially when you’re on a tight schedule. ‍ 90% of content creators report experiencing burnout, with 71% saying it made them consider quitting entirely. ‍ Efficient social media tools help automate repetitive tasks and alleviate the mental load of constant content creation ​(Tubefilter). ‍ That’s why I use the music in Zebracat. No more searching, downloading, organizing, or trying to remember where I saved the files. ‍ You just click “Music,” and Zebracat has everything organized by genre. You can find the right track instantly, with no worries about copyright issues. Super easy! Captions If you want animated pop-up captions, there’s no need to use any extra tools. ‍ Just use Zebracat!

Optimize Videos for SEO Yay! You’ve made awesome content, but just posting isn’t enough. You need to make it SEO-friendly if you want your video to blow up: Use a title with keywords people search for. You don’t want it lost in the crowd! Add trending hashtags. They help the algorithm know what your video is about. Make a thumbnail that grabs attention and makes people want to click. Use video chapters so viewers can easily follow along. To automate all of this, you can use tools like TubeBuddy or VidIQ. Personally, I use TubeBuddy because it’s super affordable—just $2.50/month, or around $1.80/month with a discount code if you pay yearly. ‍ TubeBuddy helps you save keywords when researching your competitors and keeps track of your content ideas. ‍ When you add their plugin and watch any YouTube video, it shows you metrics like the channel’s SEO score, hashtags, and keywords used in the title and description. ‍ You can also save competitors' hashtags directly to your TubeBuddy account and easily add them to your videos. No more manually checking lists or files—just pick the hashtag file you want, and your content is instantly SEO optimized. Image Source ‍ And if you're unsure what keywords or title to use for your next video, just search in TubeBuddy’s Keyword Explorer. ‍ It ranks keywords from most to least searched and links you to competitor videos. It’s super efficient. You can see which content from your competitors ranks for each keyword and which videos have the most views, all in the dashboard! With all of these tools, you can already automate your YouTube channel right now! But if you’re curious about what other tools can help you grow your YouTube automation channel, check out “Best AI Tools to Create Faceless Videos in 2025.” ‍ Best Practices and Tips for Effective Automation Automated content creation can feel overwhelming if you try to tackle everything at once. It’s tempting to want all the benefits right away, but trust me, taking it step by step will save you from headaches. Start Small and Scale When I first started using automation, I wanted to fix everything at once—scheduling, editing, SEO, all of it. But it felt like trying to clean an entire messy house in one hour. I ended up frustrated and back where I started. ‍ The better way? Tackle one room at a time. Start with the thing that’s draining your energy the most. For me, it was editing. So, I used Zebracat to create videos faster without getting stuck in the tiny details. Once that was under control, I moved on to SEO and started using TubeBuddy for tags and titles. ‍ This way, I could actually see progress. And honestly? Seeing that one part of my process was smoother gave me the motivation to keep going. ‍ You don’t need to automate everything right away. Pick one small thing, make it work, and then build from there. ‍ Take it slow, and you’ll feel the difference. Bit by bit, your channel will run smoother, and you’ll get back the time you thought you’d lost forever. Regularly Check Automated Processes Even the most reliable systems need regular check-ups. ‍ Think of your best YouTube automation tools as a well-tended garden; without consistent care, weeds can overtake the beauty. Regularly reviewing your automated processes ensures they align with your channel's goals and adapt to any changes. ‍ For example, if you've automated video uploads or SEO tasks, periodically assess whether the metadata generated remains relevant. ‍ Trends evolve, and outdated tags or descriptions can negatively impact your visibility. Tools like VidIQ can alert you to shifts in your niche, allowing you to adjust your strategy accordingly. Balance Automation with Human Touch YouTube workflow automation is a powerful tool, but it shouldn't replace your unique voice and creativity. Viewers connect with authentic content. ‍ While platforms like Zebracat can streamline video creation, adding personal elements—such as responding to comments or hosting live Q&A sessions—keeps your audience engaged. ‍ Brands combining automation with human interaction saw higher engagement rates than those relying solely on automation. Use automation to handle repetitive tasks, freeing up time for activities that require your personal touch. ‍ \"Automation is great for the grunt work,\" I often say, \"but the heart of your channel—the connection with your audience—should always come from you.\" Maintain Consistency with Branding Think about your best friend. They’ve got their signature style—maybe it’s a favorite hoodie or those worn-out sneakers they always wear. ‍ Then one day, they show up in a sharp suit and fancy shoes. You’d stop and stare, right? Not because they look bad, but because it doesn’t feel like them. ‍ That’s exactly how your audience feels when your branding suddenly changes. If your thumbnails, fonts, or tone aren’t consistent, it throws them off. It feels like they’ve landed on someone else’s channel, and that trust you’ve built starts to fade. ‍ Automation can help you keep things steady. Tools like Zebracat make it easy to create templates for intros and outros that match your style every time. Use the same colors, fonts, and layout so your audience always knows it’s you. Track and Adjust Based on Analytics Automation without checking your numbers is like driving with your eyes closed—you might be moving, but you have no idea where you’re going. Take time to look at your channel’s performance. Tools like YouTube Studio show you what’s working, like how long people watch your videos or how often they click on your thumbnails. If some videos don’t click with your audience, tweak your approach and create more of what they love. FAQs ‍ How Does Automation Affect YouTube Channel Engagement? Picture this: You’re throwing a party. You’d want everyone to feel welcome, right? Automation can help with stuff like managing the guest list or sending reminders, but if it’s overdone, people might feel like they’re just another name on a list. ‍ Same deal with YouTube—automation can make posting videos and handling comments easier, but too much can make your channel feel... kinda impersonal. People want to feel like there’s a real person behind the screen. If your replies seem automated, viewers might not stick around because they don’t feel valued. What Are the Risks of Automating YouTube Content? Automation’s a time saver, but it’s not perfect. Think of it like a double-edged sword. ‍ On one side, it helps you get things done faster, but on the other, it can mess things up if you’re not careful. For example, you might accidentally post something irrelevant or poorly timed if you’re not watching closely. ‍ Overdoing automation can also make your channel feel robotic—like sending a pre-printed birthday card instead of a handwritten one. It’s just... meh. People come to YouTube for the personal vibe, so don’t lose that! How Can I Automate Responses to Comments on YouTube? Automating responses is like having a helpful friend at your party who greets people and answers basic questions. Tools like YouTube’s moderation features or bots can handle stuff like “Thanks for watching!” or FAQs. ‍ But here’s the thing: not every comment should get an automated reply. Sprinkle in some real responses to—it shows your viewers you’re paying attention and that they matter. A mix of both works best! Is It Possible to Automate Live Streams on YouTube? You can totally automate parts of your live streams!. Tools like OBS Studio or Streamlabs can help schedule streams or set up graphics automatically. But here’s the kicker: live streams are all about interacting with your audience in real time. So, while you can automate the setup, you still need to be there, chatting and connecting with your viewers. That’s what makes live streams awesome. Can I Automate Ad Placement in My YouTube Videos? Yes, you can. You don’t have to do anything—YouTube already places ads automatically on your videos. ‍ However, if you want to control what types of ads appear, how many should show up, where they should appear, and when they should play, you’ll need to set it up yourself or hire a virtual assistant to do it for you. ‍ This process can be quite time-consuming, and so far, there aren’t any tools to automate this. But I’ll keep you updated if anything changes! ‍ But don’t go overboard with ads. Too many can annoy viewers and make them click away. Keep a balance—ads should work with your content, not ruin the vibe. ‍ Conclusion While AI can automate your YouTube channel entirely, I still recommend keeping an eye on it to maintain authenticity. ‍ AI is powerful and has a lot of potential, but it's still in its early stages and can’t fully replace you. Don’t ignore your content completely. The best way to grow long-term is to create a lot of worthwhile videos with Zebracat and keep monitoring your channels to bring your channel to the next level. ‍ Influencer List Widget Create videos from blog post in 1 minute! 85% of your audience craves more video.

Ready to dominate YouTube Automation? Enroll in our course today before the price goes up! What is YouTube Automation? YouTube automation is basically setting up a system where you can run a YouTube channel without having to do all the work yourself. Instead of filming videos, writing scripts, or editing every day, you outsource or use tools to handle the heavy lifting. For example, you can hire freelancers to create content or use AI to help with script writing and thumbnails. It's all about working smarter, not harder, so you can keep pumping out videos while having more free time to focus on growth, ideas, or even just chilling. The cool thing is, you don’t need to be a YouTube expert to get started. With the right tools and strategies, even beginners can start automating a channel. You pick a niche, build a content plan, and let others take care of most of the production. Whether it’s finding editors on platforms like Fiverr, or script writers on discord, automation makes it possible to scale up fast without being glued to your screen all day. 5 Major Reasons Why YouTube Automation Is Not Saturated YouTube Automation’s User Base Is Increasing Day By Day The number of YouTube users is exploding every single day, which is why YouTube automation isn’t anywhere near saturated. More people are watching, creating, and sharing videos across the platform, which means there's always room for new creators to jump in and succeed. Find Your Winning Niche With The Nexlev Niche Finder—Start Exploring Today! With billions of active users, YouTube’s audience keeps expanding, giving automated channels a growing pool of viewers to tap into. So even if more people are starting channels, the massive user base means there’s still enough space for everyone to find their corner of success. YouTube Automation Depends Upon Content Demand The key to YouTube automation is that it thrives on content demand. As long as people want more videos, especially on trending or evergreen topics, automated channels have the potential to thrive. The trick is understanding what content people are looking for and delivering it consistently. Whether it’s crime, documentaries, or celebrity news, the demand for content never dies down. so even though automation is becoming more common, channels that can meet that demand will continue to grow and succeed. YouTube Automation Can Leverage Untapped Niches One of the best things about YouTube automation is the ability to explore untapped niches. There are always new areas in bodycam content, woke culture, or trends that haven’t been flooded with creators yet. Finding a niche that hasn’t blown up yet gives you a huge advantage, allowing your automated channel to build a dedicated audience before competition gets too stiff. Automation helps you push out content faster and more efficiently, letting you dominate that space before everyone else catches on. Growing And Advancing Tools And Tech The tech and tools available for YouTube automation are constantly getting better. From AI-assisted video creation to advanced niche finding tools, automation technology is making it easier to run a successful channel without doing all the work yourself. These tools allow you to outsource tasks like finding trends and niches, thumbnail creation, or even scriptwriting, helping you simplify your workflow and scale your channel. With these advancements, automated channels can produce high-quality content at a fraction of the effort it used to take, keeping things from getting saturated. Reaching A Global Audience Via Videos One of YouTube’s biggest strengths is its global reach.

Ways To Monetize YouTube Automation Channels Sponsors Sponsorships are one of the most lucrative ways to monetize a YouTube automation channel. Brands pay creators to promote their products or services, either through dedicated videos or subtle integrations within regular content. The amount you can earn from sponsors depends on your channel’s size, niche, and audience engagement. Channels with a highly engaged, niche-specific audience tend to attract more high-paying sponsorship deals. To land sponsors, reach out to companies in your niche or sign up for influencer marketing platforms that connect brands with YouTube creators. It’s important to ensure that the sponsored content aligns with your audience’s interests to maintain trust and authenticity. Digital products Selling digital products is another excellent way to monetize a YouTube automation channel. Digital products can include e-books, online courses, notion templates, or even exclusive video content. This revenue model is attractive because you only need to create the product once, and then you can sell it repeatedly with no extra cost. For automation channels, the key is to create digital products that solve your audience’s problems. For example, if your channel focuses on making money, offering a budget-planning tool or a guide on investing can generate significant revenue. Promoting digital products through your videos and descriptions can help drive sales, allowing you to earn passively over time. Affiliates Affiliate marketing allows you to earn a commission by promoting other companies’ products or services. Every time someone clicks your affiliate link and makes a purchase, you earn a percentage of the sale. The great thing about affiliate marketing is that it requires minimal effort once set up. For example, a tech channel might promote software, while a fitness channel might include links to workout gear. Affiliate programs like Amazon Associates or specialized networks in your niche offer easy entry points for this monetization strategy. Memberships And Donations Memberships and donations allow your most loyal followers to support your channel directly in exchange for exclusive content or perks. Platforms like Patreon or YouTube’s own membership feature enable creators to offer different tiers of support. This model is particularly effective for automation channels with a dedicated and engaged audience. Donations can also come through platforms like PayPal or Ko-fi, where viewers contribute as a way of showing appreciation for your content. Coaching Services Offering coaching services is another way to monetize a YouTube automation channel, especially if your content positions you as an expert in a particular field. Whether it’s providing one-on-one business advice, helping others with YouTube growth, or offering niche-specific consulting. Start Automating Your YouTube Channel Today And Unlock Success In 2025! Many creators package their knowledge and experience into personalized coaching sessions or group workshops. You can promote these services directly through your videos, guiding viewers to sign up for consultations or courses. This approach works well for channels focused on education, self-improvement, or business, where the audience is willing to pay for deeper insights and guidance.

craziest part they're doing it with simple educational videos that take less than an hour to make look at these numbers this channel aperture has grown to over 2.39 million subscribers their latest video The Man Who solved Life Hit 115,000 views in just 3 days and videos like brain rot doesn't have to control you are pulling in over 600,000 views if we go ahead and sort their videos by popular we can see an entire Library of videos that are getting Millions upon millions of views I spent 24 hours analyzing their entire Channel and what I discovered is absolutely gamechanging they're using AI Tools in a way I've never seen before and today I'm going to show you exactly how to recreate three of their most viral videos while other creators are spending weeks on research and editing you'll be able to create these videos in minutes I know it sounds impossible but watch this here's a video I made in just 15 minutes that's just as good as apertures viral hits in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the IAL of existence imagine a civilization so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself in this video I'll show you exactly how to create content like this from finding viral topics to generating professional videos with AI we're going to break down three specific videos that got them millions of views so before we get into creating the first video let me introduce the tool we are going to use to create these videos the tool I've been using is nid AI version 3 to get started open up their website I'll leave a link in the description below and make sure to select version 3.0 in the menu right here instead of version 2.0 once you've got that selected I want you to click on explore all flows right here once you do that you'll see all the possibilities open up and you can see that there's a lot to be done you've got AI shorts 15-second Clips script video screenplay animated ads Tik Tok Shop videos explainer videos anime style videos Minecraft animations now let's just start off simple let me show you how you can create a stoic Style video just like their most popular one so first we need to ensure the right mode is selected for that go to your text command and right below that click on workflows and now I will choose the one called documentary since I think it is the appropriate one for this topic now to keep things simple as we're just starting out I'll select 3 minutes for the duration of our video next up we need to describe our topic this is basically where you tell the AI what type of video you want to make now for this I've actually been using chat GPT basically I asked it to create a prompt for a video about a story that will be made about stoicism I will also mention the fact that I want this video to have dark Vibes as it perfectly fits the stoic Niche if you want to use that prompt structure too I will drop it below anyway I'm going to copy this paste that in right there and that's that now just know you can also just do the prompt yourself just in nid Ai and it will also create a story line and all of that good stuff for you I just prefer to have super accurate inputs and that's why I do this all right now next up you have to choose the style now by default if you came through one of the workflows that style will be selected so we've got clation however you can can obviously click on this drop- down menu here and choose any other style you want and then Additionally you can add all of these other things such as background music language captions and the list goes on whichever one you want to add you want to click on the plus icon so I'm going to click on language and make sure it's set in English if I want to change it to any other language just know that it's possible simply select the one you'd like to go with and that goes for any of the additional features you know what to have precise control over our final product I want to configure the voice over right away so click right here on voice voice actors button now I will set it to be male voice would be the one called heavy Northern English voice and then make sure you have the narrator selected now what is very important is that you click on media preference and then here you want to change only use stock media to only generated media by doing this you'll make sure that they're not taking any footage from their b-roll library but instead they're only going to use generative AI to get your movie done which is exactly what we want to do so I'm going to select that and there we go I'm just going to go with this and see what we get what the AI is now going to do is analyze are prompt as soon as all of that is done it's going to ask us some audience preferences and that looks like this I can now select the type of audience I want to create this video for now complete the remaining settings I will select the following options and now let's move on to see the result imagine for a moment you're standing amidst ancient Greek ruins at dawn the Golden Light washing over crumbling Stone what if I told you that right here over 2,000 years ago a philosophy was born that could change your life today must say that looks really good I mean let's analyze this there's an actual story line the overall aesthetic just looks really good the colors are absolutely amazing in my opinion this turned out just the way it should have however let's say that you're not happy with something that it created for example scene number one the opening in my opinion can be a lot better I want to actually replace this with something else and so what you would do is click on the edit button right there and then you want to select a clip that you would like to replace so I am going to select clip number one just like that I can then then click on generative media on the right hand side then check the duration of this clip which is 3 seconds click on generate media in the top left and then I'm going to describe a scene so just type in a prompt of your new shot and what you want to see once you've given it that prompt you want to click generate a clip just like that and it's then going to adjust the video and there we go so it actually did that and it's quite a cool shot I must say remember to click on replace and then save changes in order to actually apply these changes and just so you know you can customize every scene just like that and the same goes for music if you click on music script if you click on script and you've also got the settings button which is brand new this basically allows you to control anything there is to your video so you've got overlay presets transitions text the volumes everything there is including each voiceovers character it's all in here all right so that was fun we got a stoic video out of the way but let's do some more work let's go back to our model Channel I will scroll down a bit and I really love this video called Butterfly Effect if we click into it we can see that it's just a bunch of abstract B- rolls with with nature and random cinematic shots well this video got over 3 million views and I believe it has to do with its catchy title because obviously the butterfly effect is a famous concept but anyway let's go back to nid and for this topic I want to go with animated video the idea here is to create an educational video for kids that demonstrates the concept of a butterfly effect I want to create a story that vividly teaches that there are consequences to everything and essentially everything you do today will come back to you in the future and with that in mind we simply want to Pivot it into a lesson that teaches kids to be mindful and respectful in general I know it sounds dramatic but that's the point I really just want to get creative here and see what we can really come up with and so with that prompt done it's set to only use generated media I can now click on continue and actually generate the video but before we do it is going to give you these options as you can see so just watch me answering these should be pretty basic and let's click generate and see what we get have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world meet Lily she's about to learn how powerful her choices can be one morning Lily helps her little brother tie his shoes looks awesome however now I want to add captions and it is actually so simple after your video is generated you can just go in here and write add English captions at the bottom of the screen now click generate and let's see the updated result have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world all right now all of that was fun but now I actually want to put this AI tool to the test let's go big and see what it can actually do there is this workflow called hyper realistic film now let's again go back to our model Channel and there is a particular video they have which I think is just perfect for this case the video is called the most advanced civilization in the universe so with that in mind let's go back to our workflow and type out our idea then I'm going to choose that it should only use generated media and then I will keep the style as the one that is selected by default and so the language I will set to English the voiceover should be a male with a clear American voice and that is it I'm going to click continue so as you can see when it comes to generating movies and films it offers you whopping 10 minutes as Max duration but I will go with 1 and 1/2 minutes just to get the results faster I will also select science fiction for the audience obviously keep it YouTube and let's [Music] proceed in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the Pinnacle of existence imagine a civiliz ation so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself they harvest the energy of entire galaxies bending the fabric of SpaceTime to their will Stellar nurseries become their playgrounds black holes their tools their technology indistinguishable from Magic reshapes reality on a whim okay what an amazing video we just watched now let's say you want to enter International markets with your AI generated movies and produce it in multiple languages guess what you can simply type in translate The Voice over to Spanish and add Spanish captions as well now click generate and let's see the applied [Music] changes now let's just talk about pricing really quick you can try nid AI but if you do want to use this new AI generative capability it does have a monthly fee so I actually bought the one that is $96 a month this is the plan that allows you to make these generative AI fully animated videos and if you're already using nid AI for other projects that are not the AI animated ones you can actually just go to the add-on section and get generative seconds here this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would otherwise spend on editing animating and other production costs so go ahead and grab this deal while it's still around with my custom link down below and if you want to see even more ways to use inv video AI I actually made a video last month where I broke down eight different ways to use it in your content creation from crafting cinematic ads to creating clips that look like they're out of a Hollywood Blockbuster just click on the screen now to watch that next",

select the type of audience I want to create this video for now complete the remaining settings I will select the following options and now let's move on to see the result imagine for a moment you're standing amidst ancient Greek ruins at dawn the Golden Light washing over crumbling Stone what if I told you that right here over 2,000 years ago a philosophy was born that could change your life today must say that looks really good I mean let's analyze this there's an actual story line the overall aesthetic just looks really good the colors are absolutely amazing in my opinion this turned out just the way it should have however let's say that you're not happy with something that it created for example scene number one the opening in my opinion can be a lot better I want to actually replace this with something else and so what you would do is click on the edit button right there and then you want to select a clip that you would like to replace so I am going to select clip number one just like that I can then then click on generative media on the right hand side then check the duration of this clip which is 3 seconds click on generate media in the top left and then I'm going to describe a scene so just type in a prompt of your new shot and what you want to see once you've given it that prompt you want to click generate a clip just like that and it's then going to adjust the video and there we go so it actually did that and it's quite a cool shot I must say remember to click on replace and then save changes in order to actually apply these changes and just so you know you can customize every scene just like that and the same goes for music if you click on music script if you click on script and you've also got the settings button which is brand new this basically allows you to control anything there is to your video so you've got overlay presets transitions text the volumes everything there is including each voiceovers character it's all in here all right so that was fun we got a stoic video out of the way but let's do some more work let's go back to our model Channel I will scroll down a bit and I really love this video called Butterfly Effect if we click into it we can see that it's just a bunch of abstract B- rolls with with nature and random cinematic shots well this video got over 3 million views and I believe it has to do with its catchy title because obviously the butterfly effect is a famous concept but anyway let's go back to nid and for this topic I want to go with animated video the idea here is to create an educational video for kids that demonstrates the concept of a butterfly effect I want to create a story that vividly teaches that there are consequences to everything and essentially everything you do today will come back to you in the future and with that in mind we simply want to Pivot it into a lesson that teaches kids to be mindful and respectful in general I know it sounds dramatic but that's the point I really just want to get creative here and see what we can really come up with and so with that prompt done it's set to only use generated media I can now click on continue and actually generate the video but before we do it is going to give you these options as you can see so just watch me answering these should be pretty basic and let's click generate and see what we get have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world meet Lily she's about to learn how powerful her choices can be one morning Lily helps her little brother tie his shoes looks awesome however now I want to add captions and it is actually so simple after your video is generated you can just go in here and write add English captions at the bottom of the screen now click generate and let's see the updated result have you ever heard of the butterfly effect it's the idea that one tiny action can change the whole world all right now all of that was fun but now I actually want to put this AI tool to the test let's go big and see what it can actually do there is this workflow called hyper realistic film now let's again go back to our model Channel and there is a particular video they have which I think is just perfect for this case the video is called the most advanced civilization in the universe so with that in mind let's go back to our workflow and type out our idea then I'm going to choose that it should only use generated media and then I will keep the style as the one that is selected by default and so the language I will set to English the voiceover should be a male with a clear American voice and that is it I'm going to click continue so as you can see when it comes to generating movies and films it offers you whopping 10 minutes as Max duration but I will go with 1 and 1/2 minutes just to get the results faster I will also select science fiction for the audience obviously keep it YouTube and let's [Music] proceed in the vast expanse of the cosmos what defines the Pinnacle of existence imagine a civiliz ation so advanced IT defies our very understanding of life itself they harvest the energy of entire galaxies bending the fabric of SpaceTime to their will Stellar nurseries become their playgrounds black holes their tools their technology indistinguishable from Magic reshapes reality on a whim okay what an amazing video we just watched now let's say you want to enter International markets with your AI generated movies and produce it in multiple languages guess what you can simply type in translate The Voice over to Spanish and add Spanish captions as well now click generate and let's see the applied [Music] changes now let's just talk about pricing really quick you can try nid AI but if you do want to use this new AI generative capability it does have a monthly fee so I actually bought the one that is $96 a month this is the plan that allows you to make these generative AI fully animated videos and if you're already using nid AI for other projects that are not the AI animated ones you can actually just go to the add-on section and get generative seconds here this will save you hundreds of dollars that you would otherwise spend on editing animating and other production costs so go ahead and grab this deal while it's still around with my custom link down below and if you want to see even more ways to use inv video AI I actually made a video last month where I broke down eight different ways to use it in your content creation from crafting cinematic ads to creating clips that look like they're out of a Hollywood Blockbuster just click on the screen now to watch that next"

Tool on Notion #aitools #aitoolsforbusiness 22 comments hey guys Jason here today I want to share with you guys nine AI tools that I wish I found sooner so I've been using some of these on a daily basis and it has saved me countless hours and the crazy thing is that some of these tools are completely free so let's get started now the first tool here is really something that I wish I found earlier cuz if you do any kind of Zoom meetings this will save you a lot of time and this is called fathom AI so fathom is an AI tool that will record your Zoom meetings but not only that but it also take notes for you and this is super useful cuz you don't have to try to remember what was said in the meetings uh yes we already have a lot of tools that can record meetings but this tool also summarizes meetings and also take notes for you so I find this tool particularly useful when I'm having a meeting on the go so let's say I'm driving and I'm having an audio Zoom call I can't bew writing notes right so fathom will not only record but it will take notes for me and later on when I'm back in the office I can just view the meeting summary or I could even share the link to the recording directly to my client and because everything is stored in the Cloud you don't have to download the recording and send huge files to share it with somebody because anyone who has the link can instantly view the recordings and all the meeting notes and also one really cool feature here is that you can also transform the whole meeting into a Q&A format cuz if you do a lot of q&as on your calls this will be super useful because you can use that for Content later on and and the best part about this is that it is free uh I mean they do have a Premium plan but the free plan is more than enough for my use case now the next tool here is called humata AI so if you do a lot of research search whether for your work or school I think you're going to like this one so humata AI is like having a research assistant so let's say you're a student you can upload your academic papers and you can ask it specific questions right if you are a working professional you can probably upload a 50 page market report and you get answers in seconds instead of having to manually scan every page now this is where the tool gets quite interesting so unlike chat gbt humata is made to handle all types of files and it can pretty much handle anything like PDF documents ments Word documents PowerPoints right which is something that you don't see very often so let me give you a quick example here so let's say you're doing research on e-commerce Trends so I've got this three market research reports about this topic so you can just direct and drop your files here and once the AI is done processing everything you can ask it to make a summary or you can ask any question about the document now if you're going over a lot of legal documents this can also do that you can ask it to watch for things that you wouldn't have caught yourself I do sign a lot of legal documents as a Creator so this is super useful as well now the next tool that I'm going to talk about has all the basic features of humata but it's actually taking it a step further and it is also a free tool and this is notebook LM so this is tool created by Google and you guys have probably seen this before and I'm not going to just tell you that it can create a podcast but I want to show you guys one really interesting trick that nobody really covered before but before I get to that for those of you who are seeing this for the first time let's talk quickly about the basic feature of notebook LM so let's say I want to create a Content about certain top topic let's say Bitcoin which is a very Hot Topic at the moment so you go to the homepage and you have the ability to upload your sources here and this tool let you add more than one source which is good because the more sources you have the better output is going to be right so I'm going to now upload an article from Wikipedia and I'm also going to upload a PDF article on bitcoin and also a YouTube video that I found on this topic so I can just paste in the URL here all right so you can see we have three files here and they're all uploaded now once you have everything in you can ask it any question you want so for example you can ask it something like can you make a summary of what Bitcoin is now you can see that it clearly breaks down everything into a summary here so it even gives you all the sources to where it got the information from which is very good and now you can even turn this entire thing into a podcast with two people talking about Bitcoin right which is by the way is my favorite feature of notebook LM so let me play this quick sample here okay so Bitcoin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that sounds crazy right now this sounds great and all but you know I've always thought how can we use this podcast for something useful and I think I found an idea and let me know what you guys think so once you have this audio podcast you can actually download this file and use the audio to create short form content that you can later post on Instagram Tik Tok or YouTube shorts and you can use a tool like revid here so this is a AI video creation tool it is really easy to use you can just upload the audio that we just created on Notebook LM and Revit will automatically generate the visuals and also the captions and here's what I was able to create in just a few minutes coin you're hearing about it everywhere right we're going to take a deep dive into it try to like really understand it not just like the buzzwords but like how it really works you know yeah like down to the nuts and bolts exactly that's really cool isn't it so yeah let me know in the comments what you guys think about this if you have some interesting use cases for Notebook LM let me know now if you're doing any kind of writing blogging social media post or even YouTube scripting this next tool here is something that you're going to want to see and this tool is not just like chat gbt that writes your content but it also includes the citations all the sources and even can automatically embed YouTube videos in your content and this tool is called SEO writing Ai and they're kindly sponsoring this video so let me show you what this tool can do now if you use chat CPT before and ask it to write an article it will probably sound like Ai and it doesn't sound natural but this AI tool has a new feature called brand voice which will let you input your writing style and all the output is going to be in your own voice and your own writing style so let me show you quickly how this works so once you're logged in you can click on brand voice and click on new brand voice now here's where you can upload any content that you've written before or any social media content so for this example I've added my documents here now you can see that it's detected my writing style and it's now G giving you a summary of how I write so I'm just going to hit save Rand voice here now let's go back to the dashboard again and create a blog post so for today's example I'm going to be writing about AI tools right so I'm going to ask it to generate the titles here and you can just regenerate until you find the one that you like and under AI model you want to select AI Cloud 3.5 Sonet I use this personally for almost all my work cuz it sounds very natural and you want your content to be easy to read as well right so set the reading level to a fifth grade student under AI words REM removal you going click basic can add any extra details if you want like specific tool names or any key points that you want to cover so I'm going to leave this blank for now but it is super useful when you need the AI to include certain information on the article and yes you can also get the AI to embed relevant YouTube videos for your post as well and now since this is a blog post we want to make it SEO friendly as well so you can either add your own keywords or let AI handle everything right I'm going to let AI do this thing here now once you're ready to publish you just hit run and watch this in about a couple seconds you get a complete blog post so if you scroll down you can see that AI has written all the content and you see the images you even have the embedded videos here and even an FAQ section which is really good for SEO right and you can see that it also has all the sources down here which is really impressive and honestly I think one of my favorite features here is the Deep Web and citation which allows the AI to use real-time data from the internet to write the most upto-date content right and of course you can go back in there and edit anything you want but this is definitely a time saer things that would take you normally hours or even days to create it's now done just in a few minutes so if you guys want to check this out you can click on the link below and use code Json 25 for 25% off on all their plans thanks again SEO writing for sponsoring this video now the next tool is called text.com so you know many of us have different messaging platforms like Instagram WhatsApp slack telegram iMessage LinkedIn right there's so many apps to manage and sometimes it's very timeconsuming to to check every single app to see if somebody's reaching out to you now this app text.com allows you to connect everything into one platform or one inbox I should say so this will work with most popular apps you see here uh even Discord and x and just look at how clean the UI is because all your conversations here are organized by person and not by app so if somebody sends you a DM on Instagram and then also another message on WhatsApp from the same person you can see the whole conversation together so you don't have to switch around different apps to see your message mesages but here's my favorite part if somebody sends you a message in another language it gets translated instantly so I think if you're using multiple platforms for your business I think this is super useful pricing wise they do have a completely free account where you can connect to 10 different platforms but obviously with a Premium plan you can access to all their AI features now the next tool is canva AI now everyone knows canva but today I'm going to show you some new AI features that they just added that you might not know about so first I'm going to talk about their new AI image generators so if you're creating banners for your website you know sometimes it's hard to find the perfect stock photo but now canva has an AI feature where you can create the perfect stock photo so you can head over a page called dreamlabs so this is where we're going to generate this stock images I'm going to type in exactly what I want like entrepreneur working from home with a cat on their desk and when I hit create it creates a unique stock image in just seconds and obviously if you don't like the results you can regenerate again and it will give you more variation so I think this is good if you already have an existing canvas subscription and you don't want to subscribe to Mid Journey or any other tools I think everything is here already but here's what I really want to show you this feature is called Magic edit so let me show you what I can do so I'm going to go back to the home screen here and create a new design and I'm going to pick Instagram post now you have two options here you can either upload your own image or you can use whatever canva has in the library so let's go to elements here and search for pen and then click on photos I'm just going to take this one here now I'm going to resize the image to fit the screen now let's say you want to replace this pan with a pencil so all you have to do here is click on Magic edit and select that specific area and type in pencil in the text box and when you hit generate in a couple seconds you can see that now the pen is replaced by a pencil pretty cool right now what if I want to remove the pencil instead I can do that as well so I can just click on edit image in the toolbar here and I'm going to look for the erase button with the Magic One icon and all you do is brush over that pencil just like this and that's it and now the pencil's gone now of course sometimes results are not perfect but canva is constantly updating this feature so the output is going to get better and more accurate with each update but this is a feature that you can normally find in Photoshop but now it's already on canvas so you don't need another subscription to get access to this feature now this next tool is what a lot of people are already using for writing and it's called clae AI but I want to show you guys a feature within claw that I really like and it's something that I use in a daily basis now if you guys are wondering yes CLA is very similar to chat TBT but I personally like this one better because I feel like the output sounds more human and more conversational and you can even train it to write or sound like a certain person right so let me give you an example here so let's say I'm creating a new YouTube video and I want it to help script it for me now I don't usually write out the entire script for my YouTube videos but I would do it on some ideas that I have trouble articulating and it's been very helpful now in order for for it to produce the content in the way I speak I can use a feature on cloud called projects and this is where you basically input all your past videos to it and all the writing will match the way you speak now the main benefit of using projects is that it will save the instructions you give it to memory so you don't have to always remind it to use your voice every time you want to ask it to write something so to do this is very simple so for example I'm going to go to this YouTube video here so I have this tool called glasp it is a Chrome extension that allows me to transform subcribe any YouTube video so I will just scroll down here and hit the copy icon here and it will just copy the entire transcript of the video now I'm going to go back to Cloud create new project and and select add content here and I'll just paste the script right here and for the title I'll just copy and paste the title from the video as well and obviously I can add more videos the more videos the better context you're going to give Claude and now you can also set the project instructions here so I like to give it more context so I would write something like this so you're an expert in business startups solopreneur ideas Founders you will be an agent acting for me to create YouTube scripts you can also make it aoid using words that sound like AI for example like digital landscape intricate pivotal it doesn't sound natural so I usually try to avoid these words and by the way you can also add to this list over time and that's it click save you're good to go now anytime you want to ask it to write whatever you want it will write it based on your instructions so you don't have to tell it to write this way or that way cuzz everything is now in memory now obviously you can use it to write whatever you want not just YouTube scripts you can use it to help you write Instagram captions LinkedIn posts X post or even Facebook ad copy all right so the next tool here is a tool that is perfect if you are a content creator on YouTube so this is called pixels and it is an AI tool that will help you replicate viral thumbnails in just seconds and I was actually impressed on what this tool can do so let me just show you briefly how this works so let's say I found a thumbnail that I like on YouTube so so I can just copy the link of the YouTube video and paste it into pixel and you will just recreate the thumbnail with the same theme same color palette and all that right look at that looks really good right now with any thumbnail generation you got three options here you got high similarity which makes it almost identical to the original thumbnail or medium which it will change some elements but you keep the style or low which allows the AI to just take some inspiration from it now here's something that's quite insane cuz you can actually take a viral thumbnail and do a face swap as well so you can use your photo to swap out the face which is really good right and you can also now add some text to the thumbnail as well now in terms of pricing the tool cost about 20 bucks a month if you upload tons of videos a month I think it's super worth it or if you're a thumbnail designer I definitely think that this will help you a lot because you can design multiple thumbnails all at once without having to edit every element manually in Photoshop now this next tool here is something that a lot of people are already using and this is notion AI now I've been using notion for a long time now to manage all my notes even planning my videos for YouTube but there's one feature of notion AI that I really like and I'm talking about the ability for the AI to help you improve your writing so as a contact Creator I write all my scripts on notion and I also have a newsletter that I write every week so I do that on notion as well so notion AI can help me improve my writing as I'm doing it on the platform so I don't have to go to CLA chat GPT to do it notion AI can do it for me right on here right so let me give you an example here so let's say I have written an introduction par paragraph on the best AI tools maybe for my newsletter so I can select the text like this and click improve writing and just in a few seconds it took my basic sentence and made it more engaging so this is super helpful if you are writing any type of copy cuz sometimes you're thinking of you know how do I structure this sentence correctly or how do I make this more convincing or more engaging and I can even ask it to change the tone of voice here so the AI will do everything right here on this page so I think this is a great feature if you already have a paid subscription to notion so you don't have to subscribe to another app to help you WR so that's all the nine tools that I have for you guys today but if you guys want to see more tools I have a list of five more tools that I use on a daily basis so if you want to check them out click on this video here and I'll see you there",

I'm going to be writing about AI tools right so I'm going to ask it to generate the titles here and you can just regenerate until you find the one that you like and under AI model you want to select AI Cloud 3.5 Sonet I use this personally for almost all my work cuz it sounds very natural and you want your content to be easy to read as well right so set the reading level to a fifth grade student under AI words REM removal you going click basic can add any extra details if you want like specific tool names or any key points that you want to cover so I'm going to leave this blank for now but it is super useful when you need the AI to include certain information on the article and yes you can also get the AI to embed relevant YouTube videos for your post as well and now since this is a blog post we want to make it SEO friendly as well so you can either add your own keywords or let AI handle everything right I'm going to let AI do this thing here now once you're ready to publish you just hit run and watch this in about a couple seconds you get a complete blog post so if you scroll down you can see that AI has written all the content and you see the images you even have the embedded videos here and even an FAQ section which is really good for SEO right and you can see that it also has all the sources down here which is really impressive and honestly I think one of my favorite features here is the Deep Web and citation which allows the AI to use real-time data from the internet to write the most upto-date content right and of course you can go back in there and edit anything you want but this is definitely a time saer things that would take you normally hours or even days to create it's now done just in a few minutes so if you guys want to check this out you can click on the link below and use code Json 25 for 25% off on all their plans thanks again SEO writing for sponsoring this video now the next tool is called text.com so you know many of us have different messaging platforms like Instagram WhatsApp slack telegram iMessage LinkedIn right there's so many apps to manage and sometimes it's very timeconsuming to to check every single app to see if somebody's reaching out to you now this app text.com allows you to connect everything into one platform or one inbox I should say so this will work with most popular apps you see here uh even Discord and x and just look at how clean the UI is because all your conversations here are organized by person and not by app so if somebody sends you a DM on Instagram and then also another message on WhatsApp from the same person you can see the whole conversation together so you don't have to switch around different apps to see your message mesages but here's my favorite part if somebody sends you a message in another language it gets translated instantly so I think if you're using multiple platforms for your business I think this is super useful pricing wise they do have a completely free account where you can connect to 10 different platforms but obviously with a Premium plan you can access to all their AI features now the next tool is canva AI now everyone knows canva but today I'm going to show you some new AI features that they just added that you might not know about so first I'm going to talk about their new AI image generators so if you're creating banners for your website you know sometimes it's hard to find the perfect stock photo but now canva has an AI feature where you can create the perfect stock photo so you can head over a page called dreamlabs so this is where we're going to generate this stock images I'm going to type in exactly what I want like entrepreneur working from home with a cat on their desk and when I hit create it creates a unique stock image in just seconds and obviously if you don't like the results you can regenerate again and it will give you more variation so I think this is good if you already have an existing canvas subscription and you don't want to subscribe to Mid Journey or any other tools I think everything is here already but here's what I really want to show you this feature is called Magic edit so let me show you what I can do so I'm going to go back to the home screen here and create a new design and I'm going to pick Instagram post now you have two options here you can either upload your own image or you can use whatever canva has in the library so let's go to elements here and search for pen and then click on photos I'm just going to take this one here now I'm going to resize the image to fit the screen now let's say you want to replace this pan with a pencil so all you have to do here is click on Magic edit and select that specific area and type in pencil in the text box and when you hit generate in a couple seconds you can see that now the pen is replaced by a pencil pretty cool right now what if I want to remove the pencil instead I can do that as well so I can just click on edit image in the toolbar here and I'm going to look for the erase button with the Magic One icon and all you do is brush over that pencil just like this and that's it and now the pencil's gone now of course sometimes results are not perfect but canva is constantly updating this feature so the output is going to get better and more accurate with each update but this is a feature that you can normally find in Photoshop but now it's already on canvas so you don't need another subscription to get access to this feature now this next tool is what a lot of people are already using for writing and it's called clae AI but I want to show you guys a feature within claw that I really like and it's something that I use in a daily basis now if you guys are wondering yes CLA is very similar to chat TBT but I personally like this one better because I feel like the output sounds more human and more conversational and you can even train it to write or sound like a certain person right so let me give you an example here so let's say I'm creating a new YouTube video and I want it to help script it for me now I don't usually write out the entire script for my YouTube videos but I would do it on some ideas that I have trouble articulating and it's been very helpful now in order for for it to produce the content in the way I speak I can use a feature on cloud called projects and this is where you basically input all your past videos to it and all the writing will match the way you speak now the main benefit of using projects is that it will save the instructions you give it to memory so you don't have to always remind it to use your voice every time you want to ask it to write something so to do this is very simple so for example I'm going to go to this YouTube video here so I have this tool called glasp it is a Chrome extension that allows me to transform subcribe any YouTube video so I will just scroll down here and hit the copy icon here and it will just copy the entire transcript of the video now I'm going to go back to Cloud create new project and and select add content here and I'll just paste the script right here and for the title I'll just copy and paste the title from the video as well and obviously I can add more videos the more videos the better context you're going to give Claude and now you can also set the project instructions here so I like to give it more context so I would write something like this so you're an expert in business startups solopreneur ideas Founders you will be an agent acting for me to create YouTube scripts you can also make it aoid using words that sound like AI for example like digital landscape intricate pivotal it doesn't sound natural so I usually try to avoid these words and by the way you can also add to this list over time and that's it click save you're good to go now anytime you want to ask it to write whatever you want it will write it based on your instructions so you don't have to tell it to write this way or that way cuzz everything is now in memory now obviously you can use it to write whatever you want not just YouTube scripts you can use it to help you write Instagram captions LinkedIn posts X post or even Facebook ad copy all right so the next tool here is a tool that is perfect if you are a content creator on YouTube so this is called pixels and it is an AI tool that will help you replicate viral thumbnails in just seconds and I was actually impressed on what this tool can do so let me just show you briefly how this works so let's say I found a thumbnail that I like on YouTube so so I can just copy the link of the YouTube video and paste it into pixel and you will just recreate the thumbnail with the same theme same color palette and all that right look at that looks really good right now with any thumbnail generation you got three options here you got high similarity which makes it almost identical to the original thumbnail or medium which it will change some elements but you keep the style or low which allows the AI to just take some inspiration from it now here's something that's quite insane cuz you can actually take a viral thumbnail and do a face swap as well so you can use your photo to swap out the face which is really good right and you can also now add some text to the thumbnail as well now in terms of pricing the tool cost about 20 bucks a month if you upload tons of videos a month I think it's super worth it or if you're a thumbnail designer I definitely think that this will help you a lot because you can design multiple thumbnails all at once without having to edit every element manually in Photoshop now this next tool here is something that a lot of people are already using and this is notion AI now I've been using notion for a long time now to manage all my notes even planning my videos for YouTube but there's one feature of notion AI that I really like and I'm talking about the ability for the AI to help you improve your writing so as a contact Creator I write all my scripts on notion and I also have a newsletter that I write every week so I do that on notion as well so notion AI can help me improve my writing as I'm doing it on the platform so I don't have to go to CLA chat GPT to do it notion AI can do it for me right on here right so let me give you an example here so let's say I have written an introduction par paragraph on the best AI tools maybe for my newsletter so I can select the text like this and click improve writing and just in a few seconds it took my basic sentence and made it more engaging so this is super helpful if you are writing any type of copy cuz sometimes you're thinking of you know how do I structure this sentence correctly or how do I make this more convincing or more engaging and I can even ask it to change the tone of voice here so the AI will do everything right here on this page so I think this is a great feature if you already have a paid subscription to notion so you don't have to subscribe to another app to help you WR so that's all the nine tools that I have for you guys today but if you guys want to see more tools I have a list of five more tools that I use on a daily basis so if you want to check them out click on this video here and I'll see you there"
