  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s take a shot at this. So, we’ve got **moodytunes.io** on our hands, and from the name alone, it’s giving off some serious vibes. You know how you have those days where you just wanna set the mood? Whether you're chilling, working, or even getting ready to go out, music can totally transform the atmosphere. I’m guessing Moody Tunes is all about that. Picture this: you land on the site, and it’s probably got a sleek and chill layout—maybe some soft colors, maybe a cool animated background that feels like you're floating in sound waves. The whole deal feels like it’s designed to get you into a specific headspace, which is kind of the point, right? I wouldn't be surprised if they have some curated playlists that reflect different moods—think “Sunday Morning Chill,” “Late Night Vibes,” or “Focus and Flow” for when you need to grind through a deadline. I can imagine they might also lean into the interactive side of things. Like, maybe there’s a feature where you can select your current mood from a set of emojis or descriptors, and then boom—a playlist gets generated just for you. It’s like having a DJ in your pocket who's tuned into your emotional wavelength. That kind of personal touch can really make a difference, especially when you’re trying to find the right soundtrack for your life’s little moments. And speaking of curated content, I wouldn’t be surprised if they had some editorial pieces or blogs discussing music theory, the psychology of music, or artist highlights. You know, stuff that not only helps you find the right tunes but also enriches your understanding of what you’re listening to. It’s all about that connection—you’re not just playing songs; you’re diving into the vibes, the feelings, and maybe even the stories behind the music. Plus, there could be a social element woven in there. Imagine being able to share your favorite playlists with friends or even collaborating on a playlist together. “Yo, I’m feeling a bit nostalgic today—let’s throw together some bangers from the early 2000s.” That kind of community vibe can really elevate the whole experience, don't you think? Now, if they’re savvy—they might have some killer features like playlist sharing through social media or integration with streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music. You could create a playlist on Moody Tunes, and then with a click, send it to your friends or share it on your Insta story. It’s all about making it easy and fun to spread the good vibes. Don’t forget the aesthetics—there's nothing like a little visual flair to make music exploration even cooler. So, I can see them showcasing album covers, artist photos, and maybe even some engaging visuals that match the mood of the playlists. It’s like a mini art gallery where you get to experience music in a whole new light. And if they’re really on their game, they might even incorporate some AI or algorithm magic to learn your preferences over time. The more you use it, the better the recommendations get. So, after a while, it's like you’ve got your own personal assistant who knows just how to curate your mood playlist—from the upbeat jams to the heart-wrenching ballads, it’s all there. So, in a nutshell, I’d say Moody Tunes is probably your go-to spot for vibing out with music that fits your mood, whether you’re looking to amp up the energy or wind down after a long day. It’s all about that connection to sound, feeling, and community. Now, pass me another beer while we jam to whatever feels right! Cheers!",

When you’re hit with a case of April showers, this is the perfect time to curl up with a warm blanket, your coziest pair of sweatpants, and unwind with a soothing playlist. If you’ve got spring fever, the last thing you want to see are gloomy skies and dark clouds occupying the warm, invigorating rays of the sun. However, while the warm weather is temporarily M.I.A., this allows you to discover some new music while you relax and watch the rainfall. Whether you’re glued to the couch or spending the day in bed, we’ve curated a few playlists from Spotify that are sure to lift your spirit and capture the pure essence of a rainy day. Grab your headphones and get ready to press “play.” 1. Rainy Day Classics If you’re a fan of 60s, 70s, and 80s hits, then you couldn’t ask for a better playlist. With 52 songs in total and over three hours of pure nostalgia, this selection of tunes will help get you through the rainy day and automatically send you back in time. This playlist is not to be confused with “dad rock” (even though your dad probably had most of these songs on cassette). This is a playlist for all ages to enjoy. It’s full of timeless, feel-good music that can help pass the time and revitalize your otherwise lethargic rainy afternoon. Featuring artists such as Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Beatles, Tom Petty, Fleetwood Mac, and more, this rainy day playlist may just turn into your everyday playlist. 2. Rainy Day Kids If you’re stuck indoors during a storm, odds are your kids are stuck at home with you. As much as kids would prefer to be outside playing with their friends, a rainy day creates an opportunity to play some fun and educational songs to keep them energized throughout the day. Songs like “Mr. Sun,” “Rain, Rain Go Away,” and “Singing in the Rain” are some all-time favorites that your kids are sure to recognize and sing along to. And any playlist that features songs by Raffi is a no-brainer if you’re searching for children's music. 3. Songs About Rain Sometimes, the best way to get through a stormy day is to embrace and immerse yourself in the weather. If it’s still pouring and the old man is still snoring, how about dedicating your playlist to songs written about rain? It makes sense to us! Songs like “Make It Rain” by Ed Sheeran, “Set Fire to the Rain” by Adele, “No Rain” by Blind Melon, and “One Rainy Wish” by Jimi Hendrix are just a few of the songs featured as part of this 52-track playlist. Whether or not you’re a fan of rainy weather, music is always the best way to add a little warmth to a chilly day. 4. Rainy Day Jazz There’s just something about a rainy day that makes you feel like sitting at a coffee shop with a latte in hand enjoying some jazz music in the background. Whether you’re a fan of smooth jazz, freeform, or bebop, this rainy day jazz playlist mimics that feeling—all you need is a fresh cup of joe. You can close your eyes and listen to the trumpets, trombones, and saxophones hitting each note with incredible elegance and vigor—envisioning a time where Miles Davis, Louis Armstrong, John Coltrane, and Duke Ellington were on top of the charts. Featuring 92 songs and over six hours of music, this playlist is sure to serve as your introductory lesson to one of the earliest and most profound genres of music. 5. Rainy Day Country If you’re not a fan of nursery rhymes, jazz, or rock music, there are plenty of other music genres out there for you to explore. Maybe you prefer country music? Well, in that case, throw on your 10-gallon hat and pair of overalls because we’ve got the ultimate rainy day country playlist, partner. With 463 songs and 24 hours of music, this playlist is long enough to outlast any storm. The artists include Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, Blake Shelton, Kacey Musgraves, Sam Hunt, and more. It might be raining, but no one can stop you from throwing your own Stagecoach Festival from home. 6. Rainy Days Music for Mellowing Out One of Spotify’s most listened to playlists on a rainy day, this collection of songs has over 62,000 likes and features 306 songs. It's a 19-hour collection of acoustic, alternative, indie, classic rock, and more. Wherever your musical preference lies, there are plenty of stellar tracks to get you through the wet and dreary day. Stormy weather is all about enjoying good music and warm beverages, so if you need a playlist to help set the vibe, this is the one for you. But beyond that, this is also a great playlist if you’re trying to study, take a nap, read, or enjoy some much-needed rest and relaxation. Turn Up the Volume Don’t let the rain get you down—instead, turn up the volume and explore a new world of musical enlightenment. And remember, you’ll need to download the Spotify app or use the Spotify web player to listen to this collection of playlists. Otherwise, you’ll be stuck looking out the window listening to the rain. And if you want to expand your musical horizons, we have an entire line of audio equipment and accessories to broaden your listening experience.

Indeed, IDEs are sometimes more of a hindrance than a help when you're learning a new programming language. However, this isn't true of CLion, which can be very helpful right off the bat. Let's run through some of the advantages of using CLion: CLion makes it easy to start a new project.

However, this isn't true of CLion, which can be very helpful right off the bat. Let's run through some of the advantages of using CLion: CLion makes it easy to start a new project. The wizard will generate a simple project structure with stub code that you can explore and run right away. Then, as you start writing code, CLion will highlight its structure and suggest improvements. This allows you to learn both the language itself and the best code practices from the very beginning. For many error cases, CLion suggests quick-fixes, which means you can start memorizing the proper solutions right off the bat. For example, the IDE catches typical errors like dangling pointers – the types of errors that might pop up a lot when you’re a newbie but can also be hard to debug. The building, running, and debugging processes are completely transparent, as are VCS operations. You can control every step, see the exact commands, parameters, and flags that are being used, and experiment with them. If necessary, you can always perform the same actions in the built-in terminal. CLion allows you to become familiar with a variety of compilers and build systems. It works with gcc, Clang, MSVC compilers, and project formats, such as CMake, Makefile, Meson, and others. Understanding the underlying assembly is important when you’re learning a language like C++. CLion allows you to examine the assembly of a file without having to build the entire project. You can change the compiler flags, refresh the assembly view, and see the effect immediately. And, of course, the IDE debugger is very convenient for learning. The IDE will help you investigate any runtime problem, including those that require memory analysis and disassembly. To summarize, CLion will not overwhelm you with a complex set-up process and will not hide the essentials in the background. You’ll be able to get up and running with a project in no time, while learning best code practices and efficient debugging right out of the gate. And if you’re a student, you can get it all for free!

Буду хранить его как зеницу ока! Звонкий голос ласкал слух и разливался теплом по телу, будто горячий чай в зимнюю стужу. Губы сами собой растянулись в улыбке, а руки, тоже сами собой, затянули в объятия. — Уж постарайся. Он не просто для красоты, поскольку это твой барьер и память в одном флаконе. — Это как? — недоумение Карин можно было считать закрытыми глазами, если бы потребовалось. Сдержать снисходительного смешка капитан не смог. — Барьер — на экстренные случаи. Пустые не будут тебя беспокоить, пока ты его не снимешь или не захочешь самостоятельно ослабить действие магии. Память же объясняется просто: медальон считывает ауру, настроение, сны и образы мыслей, записывая их на встроенный носитель. Как камера, но духовных материй. — Ого, что-то запредельно внушительное… А второе мне зачем? — Чтобы ничего не забывала, конечно же. Стоит тебе его открыть потайной кнопкой, как все записанные фрагменты вернутся обратно в сознание. Очень удобная штука. В голове возникли первые ростки сомнения. Нетипичное поведение, памятный подарок, странные разговоры и улыбка, что лучезарнее солнца в ясный зимний день… Он что, прощается с ней? «Да нет, быть такого не может». Ростки были агрессивно задушены уверенностью: если Тоширо что-то делает, то никогда — просто так. Видимо, активность пустых в городе снова выросла, или работы в Готее прибавилось настолько, что увидятся они снова ещё нескоро и таким образом он заботится об её безопасности, а запись жизни в медальон в принципе интересная технология, испытать которую Карин совершенно не против. А вытащить из него подробности она ещё успеет. В конце концов, память — это всё, что с нами остаётся, уходит от нас и от нас остаётся. Разменная монета в гача-автомате, с первой и единственной попыткой спасти и унести с собой в Сансару. Всегда ва-банк. — Действительно универсальный… гаджет. Гаджет ведь? И хотя с памятью у меня всё прекрасно, в будущем это может стать палочкой-выручалочкой. Высокоуровневая духовная технология или что-то около того? — Она самая. Схватываешь на лету. — Интересно, заменит ли она ваши смартфоны в будущем… — На самом деле капитан Куротсучи уже вовсю работает над модернизацией устройства. — Что ж, такими темпами и до смарт-часов доберётесь: видят боги, недалёк тот день! — Карин задорно рассмеялась и ответила на объятия крепче обычного, утыкаясь носом в выемку косодэ с оголённой кожей, что чуть ниже привычного глазу лазурного цвета шарфа. Тепло в теле юного капитана десятого отряда сменилось на «горячо» как по щелчку пальцев, немного испугав. Тоширо молился, чтобы она не заметила. Каждый раз, каждый раз она умудрялась сделать что-то непостижимое уму, телу, чувствам, и каждый раз — случайность, граничащая с фатальностью. Для него так точно. Неловкую идиллию прервала отвратительно звонкая мелодия из смартфона Тоширо, и судя по безнадёжному выражению лица, звонил кто-то, с кем дела иметь он точно не горит желанием. — Хирако, какого чёрта… Что ж, думаю, на сегодня всё, работа не ждёт. Береги себя. — Погоди-погоди, секундочку! — Карин едва успела схватиться за полы хаори и остановить парня от перехода в Сенкаймон и в ответ получила вопросительный взгляд. — Ты же не показал, как именно считывать воспоминания. — А, точно, — капитан спрыгнул на землю, как ни в чём не бывало, и в один шаг сократил между ними расстояние до критического уровня, на выдохе соприкоснувшись с губами девушки. Озорная улыбка вновь тронула лицо, и Тоширо, наблюдая за оторопевшей и враз растопившейся Карин, ловко развернул медальон обратной стороной и указал на едва заметную кнопочку под корпусом с подвижными частями: стоило её нажать, как едва видимая беловатая позёмка потянулась к лицу, будто обдавая неким ароматом… Перед глазами тотчас же мелькнула картинка событий минутной давности, оказавшись красочнее и ярче настоящей. Неужели она всё видит именно так? — Сумасшедший. — От такой же слышу-у-у, — нараспев протянул капитан и пожал плечами. — Ты смотри осторожней, я могу вернуть первоклашку в оборот в любой момент, — такой подставы от Карин он явно не ожидал, наспех состряпав возмущённую рожицу. — Эй! В ответ снова заливистый смех, от которого внезапно сильно кольнуло где-то в области сердца. Задор вмиг потух, оставив на поверхности вязкий привкус чего-то… Далёкого, едва забытого. «Я не готов». — К слову, присмотрись внимательнее к медальону-то. — Я что-то упустила? — Кто знает… Ох уж эта его фирменная фраза… Вроде и бесила, а вроде и не очень. Карин хотела убедиться в сказанном и повернула медальон лицевой стороной к себе. Медленно и трепетно раскрыла крылья, под которыми — внезапно — прятались вытесненные серебром слова. «You’re my Sunshine». От нахлынувших чувств хотелось разрыдаться прямо здесь и сейчас. Как она могла не заметить этого?! Как могла сомневаться в нём? Ответ вот же он, на ладони, сейчас, буквально. Как же тепло. Вот бы этот миг длился вечность. *** После недельного отпуска и последующего возвращения Хицугаи Тоширо в Общество Душ, привычный мир Куросаки Карин вновь начал обнимать со всех сторон. Подготовка к поступлению в ВУЗ плавно перетекала в обязанности медсестры в клинике отца; иногда оставалось время на дружеские футбольные матчи и тренировки на крытых площадках со старой гвардией бессменных товарищей детства и даже на посиделки с подругами в уютных кофейнях. Раз в неделю она виделась с племянником (чему была очень рада) и училась азам кулинарии у Юзу. Всё это очень захватывало внимание, затягивало в пучину реальности, где нет почти места чему-то нематериальному, духовному. Удивительное дело, но, кажется, барьер медальона действительно работал — назойливых духов в доме заметно поубавилось, они больше не докучали Карин своим чрезмерным вниманием, скорее даже наоборот: сторонились и тихо ворчали. Что ж, лишний груз — долой с плеч. И всё же, во всей этой бытовой суматохе ей частенько удавалось общаться с Тоширо не только в мессенджере, но и с помощью видео-аудио звонков. В силу занятости разговоры были недолгими, но приятными и согревающими долгими зимними вечерами. Казалось, этого вполне достаточно для счастья, что теплилось маленьким подсолнухом под рёбрами и холодило металлом ключицы. Казалось, он вот-вот снова спустится в Генсей, хотя бы на денёк, расскажет всё с глазу на глаз и во всех подробностях, вновь спонтанно предложит место, которое хотел бы посетить вместе с ней, вновь обнимет крепко-крепко посреди футбольного поля и скажет то, что давно вертится на языке у обоих… Казалось, у этого сна нет конца. Она резко подорвалась на кровати, даже толком не успев раскрыть глаз. В холодном поту, дрожащая как осиновый лист, с тяжёлым и громким дыханием, Карин на ощупь стала искать стакан воды, который всегда ставила на ночь на такие случаи. Осушив его за три больших глотка, она зашлась в резком кашле: пить воду такими порциями было плохой идеей. — Карин, что случилось? — приглушённый заботливый и слегка встревоженный голос с другой части кровати в полусне пытался понять происходящее. — В-всё нормаль… кхе-кхе, нормально, водой подавилась, бывает. — Тебе помочь? — голос стал ближе: обладатель незаметно переполз на её часть и попытался растереть кожу меж лопатками, но его мягко остановила едва дрожащая рука. — Нет-нет, не нужно этого делать, уже прошло почти. Всё хорошо, правда. Только испугалась немного, пойду, подышу свежим воздухом. — Хорошо. Если буду нужен — зови, — громко зевая, мужчина переполз обратно на свою территорию, подмял под шею подушку и мгновенно унёсся в страну грёз, ибо работу по понедельникам ещё никто, к великому сожалению, не отменял. — Нужен… Ох, если б ты знал… — полушёпот отозвался остаточным першением в горле, которое тотчас заставило замолчать. Карин медленно и наугад шаркала тапочками в сторону любимой лоджии, где её ждали почти полная луна, тишина ночного города и мягкое кресло. Когда голова раскалывается на части, а щёки сушатся от солёной влаги, она всегда там: в любой сезон, в любую погоду. Стоило стеклянной двери отъехать в сторону, как на девушку обрушился нескончаемый поток ноябрьского воздуха. Ненужные мысли выветрились при первом порыве ледяного ветра, позволяя слабой улыбке появиться на лице. Однако стоило Карин начать вспоминать сон, как всё наглым образом возвратилось на круги своя, отдаваясь пульсирующей болью в висках. «Это снова был он». Очертания во сне так расплывались, что она с трудом могла бы вспомнить даже малую часть его образа. Мысли скомкались. Рука непроизвольно потянулась к медальону, который она упрямо продолжала носить, но шальная мысля тотчас же была загашена силой воли. «Забыла же, отпустила… И что в итоге? Триумфальное возвращение к самоедству и бесполезному анализу, прекрасно. Докатились, Карин, конечная. Дальше только дурка», — невесёлые мысли текли ручьём в лунном свете приморского городка Сакунами, постепенно разветвляясь на поворотах и утекая сквозь пальцы ввысь, вслед за ветром. В какой-то момент ей тоже захотелось стать этим ручейком: маленьким, незаметным. Она смогла бы улететь ввысь и узнать у своих братьев-ручейков о делах, творящихся в мире ином. Послушать сплетни, посмеяться, ужаснуться, поплакать и вновь засмеяться. Улыбнуться, успокоиться и плавно спланировать вниз, в родной дом, где тебя любят и ждут. Славное путешествие бы вышло, скажи? Ветер задул сильнее. В носу что-то закололо. Холодало. «К чёрту это всё. Тревоги и слёзы остались в прошлой жизни, разве нет? Ты себе обещала, так выполняй обещание!», — слегка воодушевлённая, бывшая Куросаки резко шмыгнула носом, вернулась в тёплую комнату и задвинула дверь обратно, оставляя за порогом всё то, что отравляло ей существование. Настала пора окончательно проснуться. *** Сегодня был последний день государственных выпускных экзаменов в ВУЗе, где Карин провела без малого шесть лет. Остатки мандража всё ещё аукались в напряжённых мышцах рук и в районе лопаток, но самое страшное теперь позади. Результаты будут нескоро, а потому и волноваться уже не было смысла. Карин глубоко вздохнула и медленно выдохнула, позволяя уставшей улыбке забрать любые волнения и сомнения. Она — выпускница. Один из самых важных и ярких жизненных этапов — позади. От одной этой мысли с ума можно сойти! В кармане кашемирового пальто шоколадного оттенка завибрировал смартфон, следом раздался звонок. — Алло. — Ну что, сдала? Дорогая, как себя чувствуешь? — Словно пёрышко! Которое окунули в смолу и пытались заставить лететь. — Ха-ха-ха, понимаю! В своё время тоже на выпускных был выжат как лимон. Главное теперь не думать о результатах и порадовать себя за проделанную работу, так ведь? — Определённо. Постой, хочешь сказать, ты всё уже устроил? — Не только я! Твои подруги, Макото и Санаэ, тоже участвовали. — Как, и без меня?! — Так ты же тесты писала и диплом защищала… — А… Точно. Забыла. Уже. Звонкий смех раздался по ту сторону экрана. — Понял, понял. Ладно, ты не задерживайся, у нас тут пир горой намечается! Локацию я уже скинул, не забудь предупредить, как подъедешь. — Хорошо, дорогой, спасибо тебе. За всё. Правда, спасибо! — Ты не разведёшь меня этим на слёзы, ты не разведёшь меня этим на слё… ай к чёрту, довела! Карин, что ты творишь? — Ясуо, я же от души! — бывшая Куросаки очень старалась не смеяться во весь голос, но получалось из рук вон плохо: прохожие недоумённо поглядывали на абсолютно счастливую девушку, однако той будто бы и всё равно на самом деле. — Я рад. Очень. Всё, жду звонка. Бай! Короткие гудки на линии красноречиво говорили о нетерпении Ясуо как можно скорее воссоединиться с женой и разделить важный и невероятно радостный момент её жизни. Карин улыбнулась своим мыслям ещё шире и бодро зашагала вперёд. Спустя какое-то время шаг сбился, и Карин уже неспешно брела в сторону отмеченной локации: муж любил открывать новые грани города вместе с ней, и поскольку переехали они из Каракуры относительно недавно, узнать новое пристанище получше и со всех сторон было банальной необходимостью. Между прочим, приятной! Тут никаких тебе криков и вечных препираний брата с отцом, взбудораженных возгласов Юзу на каждый чих со стороны потенциальных кавалеров своей сестры, беготни племянника с друзьями по всему дому, отвратительнейших духов и призраков всех мастей и пород, которые в какой-то момент почему-то вновь заполонили дом… А ещё никаких пьяных криков Ренджи, Иккаку, Рукии-сан и Рангику-сан, которые активно захаживали к Ичи-нии побазарить за жизнь и заодно попробовать вытащить того погулять семейными компаниями на свет божий, иначе, со слов той же Рукии-сан, тот «совсем превратится из домоседа в хиккана, а так хоть траву потрогает». И где только она понабралась новомодных словечек?.. К счастью, заведение оказалось недалеко: если верить карте, двадцать минут неспешной ходьбы и девушка на месте. Приятным бонусом служило то, что часть пути пролегала по выделенной дорожке вдоль берега Японского моря, откуда порывистый ветер гнал свинцовые серые тучи, влагу и солёный воздух. Порой он свирепел, трепля слои одежды из стороны в сторону, будто желая утащить их с собой на дно морское вместе с хозяйкой. Да и в целом погода сегодня будто вторила её душе: такой же растрёпанной, уставшей, но с оптимизмом смотрящей в будущее. На половине пути она резко почувствовала озноб. Пробирающий до кончиков пальцев, вызывающий стройный табун мурашек по загривку, шее, и дальше змейками уползая под лопатки. Следом раздался негромкий чих. «Никак простыть успела? Ага, конечно, я — и простыть по такому пустяку? Не в этой жизни». Тут что-то другое. Такое знакомое, такое… родное? Карин поёжилась и обхватила плечи руками: озноб будто пронзал саму душу. «Эта реацу…» Стоило ей отвернуть голову от морского пейзажа в поисках источника холода, как голова вдруг запульсировала тупой болью в висках, совсем как в нынешнюю беспокойную ночь. Картинка перед глазами на мгновение поплыла: на переносицу излишне давили носоупоры, и декоративные очки пришлось снять. Правда, легче от этого не стало, потому что видение никуда не делось. Привет из прошлого, который она боялась встретить больше всего на свете, сейчас стоит прямо перед ней. Подросший, на вид смертельно уставший, но всё такой же растрёпанный и миловидный. В горле мгновенно пересохло. Будь её воля, выпила бы она всё море до дна. — Т-ты… — Карин потребовалась вся дремлющая в ней сила воли, чтобы сглотнуть тугой ком, что так некстати подкатил прямо к языку, и продолжить смотреть в бессовестные глаза цвета лазурного моря. Странное дело, ведь раньше её невозможно было так быстро развести на эмоции, а тут… — Не ожидал найти тебя здесь, — голос, что почти не изменился со дня их последней встречи, немного сел и едва заметно дрогнул. В нём было столько… печали? Безнадёги? Облегчения? Тихой радости? Она не могла распознать сходу. — И я тоже. Давно не виделись, Тоширо. «Как там говорили? Сколько от прошлого ни беги, оно обязательно настигнет и застанет врасплох? Что за придурок придумал эту концепцию? Хочу от души дать ему в рожу! И не смей разводить сырость, слышишь? Не смей, только не сейчас!» — вопреки беспорядочным мыслям, Карин вымученно улыбнулась. В области сердца тотчас же кольнуло и тяжко заныло. — Да… давно. Оба одновременно отвели взгляд в сторону, воцарилось неловкое и тяжёлое молчание. Пять лет — не много и не мало, если так посмотреть. Для него — будто месяц промелькнул, для неё — бесконечная вереница дней в глухой тиши собственного мира, в котором солёные реки впадали в солёное море, бесконечный горизонт упирался в острые углы, а пресловутая реальность держала в бесконечно глубоком сне, полном счастья и жизни. Но стоило лишь на секунду заглянуть в эти глаза, стоило лишь на секунду дать слабину, как небо вдруг пошло глубокими трещинами, вода в море вскипела, а счастье, что Карин крепко держала в руках, беззвучно рассыпалось, развеялось прахом по ветру. Вот так просто — раз! — и всё. Слабачка, не сумевшая усмирить пропитанные насквозь -его- запахом мысли и эмоции. Пряности, зелёный чай и сладкое послевкусие — так она запомнила его объятия пять лет назад и абсолютно такой же запах витал сейчас рядом с ней. Мир вдруг схлопнулся и сузился до неё, свистящего ветра в ушах и вечно взъерошенного шинигами напротив. Да, пожалуй, она наконец проснулась. — Ты здесь по делам Готея? — Карин медленно подошла к деревянному ограждению, что сопровождало её весь нынешний путь, облокотилась о перила и устремила взгляд в беспокойное море. Не хотелось начинать издалека, но слова сами слетели с губ. — Если я скажу «да», ты поверишь? — за спиной едва заметно шевельнулись полы белоснежного хаори. Послышался шорох варадзи, и пряности оказались совсем рядышком, нагло ударяя в нос. Тоширо почти в точности повторил позу девушки, вставая едва плечом к плечу. Сейчас у него не было абсолютно никакого права украдкой разглядывать её лицо, поэтому взгляд также блуждал по морским гребням волн. — Знаешь, Сакунами хоть и соседствует по северной стороне от Каракуры, но местных духов здесь раз-два и обчёлся, все абсолютно безвредные. Тех редких пустых, появляющихся от силы раза два за месяц, успевают уничтожить ещё до того, как человек вроде меня что-либо вообще поймёт. Капитаны же, насколько мне известно, спускаются на грунт либо по особым заданиям вроде патруля, либо по личным делам. Кроме того, Сакунами вроде как вообще не под твоей юрисдикцией, поэтому нет, не поверю. — Так и думал, от тебя ничего не утаишь — сбоку послышался тяжёлый вздох. — На самом деле мне потребовалось время, чтобы разузнать, где тебя искать. — Даже не буду спрашивать зачем, но могу предположить, что папаша мой слил всё как на духу, да? — уха коснулась горькая усмешка. — Абсолютно. Я не просил, но Ишшина было не заткнуть. — Вот как… — Карин аккуратно заправила прядь волос за ухо и замолчала. Мысли, мысли, мысли и ещё миллион таких же водили хороводы, прыгали друг через друга, наслаивались и растворялись в кислоте эмоций одна за другой. Слов не осталось, их забрал ветер, передавая эстафету снежному юноше рядом, скатываясь на языке в ожидании… чего? Извинений? Оправданий? Ничего из этого даже близко не перекроет тот злополучный период жизни, когда она была на короткой ноге с пограничными состояниями, и у края уже заманчиво зияла бездонная дыра с депрессией, соблазняя прыгнуть в неё с каждым днём всё сильнее. На самом деле действительно было интересно услышать причины столь внезапного, нахрен, исчезновения из её жизни, однако капитан не особо спешил раскрывать все карты, и это почему-то раздражало. — Карин, я… Мне столько нужно тебе сказать, но я даже не могу понять с чего начать… — тяжесть его слов грузом ложилась на сердце, поднимая тем самым внутри волну праведного гнева. — А, ну ты подумай тогда, мы вроде не спешим. Лет пять в запасе точно ещё есть. Вкрадчиво, отстранённо, слишком холодно. Ох. Едкий укол попадает точно в сердце, выбивая на мгновение весь воздух из лёгких и едва не подкашивает ноги. Хорошо, что под руками была опора. Из кармана пальто послышалась приятная мелодия звонка. Карин незамедлительно вытянула смартфон и подняла трубку. — Да? Да, я скоро буду, решила немного прогуляться. Ничего, если слегка подзадержусь? Да, пожалуйста. Спасибо, до встречи, — она уже как наяву видит перед собой беспокойные лица девочек и Ясуо, которые наверняка распознали натянуто-дружелюбный тон разговора и ждут от неё ответов. Но ответов они, скорее всего, не услышат. Настоящих — никогда. Не так поймут. — Тебя, видимо, заждались. Могу проводить? Карин оторопела от услышанного. Грешным делом подумала на слуховые галлюцинации. Резко развернулась, хлестанув по лицу угольно-чёрными прядями волос и отчаянно старалась заглянуть в эти нахальные глаза, что так же отчаянно бегали от неё. — Ты, должно быть, шутишь… — уголок губ девушки нервно задёргался. — Ты же шутишь, да? Знаешь, это охренеть как не смешно, потому что меня не нужно провожать, мне нужны ответы! Ответы, Тоширо, слышишь?! — Карин вспыхнула словно спичка. Хватая капитана за грудки, сминая хаори и косодэ, она силой пыталась вытрясти из него хоть что-то кроме сочувствия и виноватого-во-всех-грехах-тона-голоса. — Почему ты так внезапно исчез, почему не отвечал ни по каким коммуникациям, избегал меня, почему не сдержал обещание, почему-почему-почему?! За что ты так со мной… — от крика она сорвала голос, и последние слова вышли слишком задушенными собственным отчаянием. Капитан, ожидаемо, даже не шелохнулся: куда уж ей там тягаться с ним в силе, однако действие возымело свой эффект. Нежно перехватывая холодную руку своими широкими и шершавыми ладонями, он тихо подносит её к самому сердцу. Карин невольно задержала дыхание и почувствовала, как под ладонью гулко пульсирует рваный ритм и тепло, будто исходившее из самой души, невидимой лентой тянулось к ней по руке — от сердца к сердцу. Свободная рука невольно потянулась к медальону. Одно движение — и он наконец раскрылся, спустя долгих пять лет ожидания проецируя на маленький воздушный экран всё, что она успела пережить за эти годы: взлёты, падения, встречи, расставания, радости и горести, ожидания и обрушенную на бывшую Куросаки реальность. Всё как на ладони, без утайки. Когда краткий фильм закончился, Карин буквально на мгновение стало страшно поднимать голову, однако желание найти ответы на свои вопросы оказалось намного сильней. …И она наконец увидела. Всё перемололось, смешалось воедино, и теперь лишь одна невыразимая тоска плескалась на дне холодного океана. Это откровение так похоже отражало её саму, так неправильно сильно резонировало с его душой, что даже самые большие сомнения вопреки здравому смыслу стремительно испарялись. — Прости. Прости меня, пожалуйста, если сможешь когда-нибудь, — Тоширо мягко затянул девушку в объятия. Совсем как тогда. Она не смогла сопротивляться этому порыву. А впрочем, хотела ли? Так чертовски похоже, боже, просто до одури. Тепло мягко окутало плечи: будто время и пространство истёрли свои границы, будто никогда и не было этих пяти лет, будто прекрасный сон, что обернулся кошмаром, испарился без следа. Будто… — Возможно, у тебя действительно были веские причины так поступать, но… — Не пытайся меня оправдать, я этого не заслуживаю. Если ты уделишь мне ещё немного времени, то я всё объясню. Вообще всё. Отвечу на любой твой вопрос, каким бы сложным он ни был. Карин, прошу… — Тогда, пять лет назад даря этот кулон, ты действительно прощался… В глазах помутнело, тугой ком встал поперёк горла, в носу неприятно закололо — и вот уже бусины слёз бесконтрольно прокладывали себе дорожки на щеках, к шее и прямиком на тёмную ткань одеяния шинигами. Дыхание окончательно сбилось, очень быстро подводя к тихой истерике. — Все эти мучительно долгие пять лет… оно болело. Нестерпимо болело, но тогда я искренне думал, что поступаю правильно, что так будет лучше… — Лучше? Для кого лучше? Для меня, для тебя или для всех сразу? А просто спросить язык отсох? Ты хоть понимаешь, в какой ад успел меня загнать, каждый день каждого года пытая надежду до последнего вздоха? Ты понимаешь, что твои действия — это чистейшей воды эгоизм?! — Карин плакала. Навзрыд, как никогда сильно. Ей казалось, что все слёзы остались ещё в детстве на могиле матери, но этот человек в мгновение ока перевернул всё с ног на голову. Непростительное преступление и предательство своих идеалов. — Я считал, что когда отношения зайдут слишком далеко — а всё к этому и шло — начнутся проблемы далеко не бытового характера, о чём любезно напоминали едва ли не в каждом учебнике во времена академии — нельзя и всё тут. Запрет, нарушение которого могло повлечь за собой серьёзную опасность. Твои родители — тому пример… — голос шинигами подозрительно сел. — Считал, что тебе лучше вообще забыть меня, мир духов и шинигами с их заботами, как ты того и хотела в детстве, ведь тогда ты точно была бы в безопасности. В итоге, за мой эгоизм поплатились двое. — Считал, что лучше забыть? — за слух зацепились эти жалящие нутро слова. — Забыть… Да, знаешь, почти получилось, Тоширо, почти получилось! Ещё парочка дней — и ты бы остался призрачным школьным воспоминанием. А теперь… Что мне теперь делать? — Что мне теперь делать… — осипший вопрос почти потерялся в непрерывном потоке разбивающихся о берег волн. Казалось, они своими силами пытались заглушить боль двух израненных душ. Объятия вдруг будто стали чуть крепче, воздух — гуще, до ушей начал доноситься едва уловимый шёпот, а на макушку упало пару капель дождя. Постойте, дождя? Так ведь… — Знаешь, без тебя даже день казался мучительной вечностью во льдах. Это не дождь. Чтобы убедиться в открытии, Карин разомкнула кольцо тёплых рук, сделала шаг назад и взглянула в уголки глаз цвета бирюзы, где собрались капли солёной воды и одна за другой скатились по прекрасному лицу, сорвавшись с подбородка вниз, к земле. Тихо-тихо, капля за каплей подводили её к черте. Таким открытым и беззащитным он не был, пожалуй, никогда ещё в своей жизни. Сердце заныло пуще прежнего. — Тоширо, я же… Я же правда ждала. Поверила той дурацкой надписи на подсолнухе. До последнего ждала. Но теперь… — Действительно ли слишком поздно? Я знаю о твоём счастливом браке, но сейчас вижу совсем иную картину. Девушку бросило в дрожь. Перепутье жизни ещё никогда не настигало её с такой сумасшедшей скоростью, открывая только две дороги: «Сейчас» или «Никогда больше». Этот шинигами, кажется, узнал больше положенного. Чёрт возьми. — Я не могу бросить мужа вот так просто, не могу! Ты должен понимать, что такое клятва верности и… — ей не дали договорить. — Я понимаю. А ещё я понимаю, что такое синергия душ, Карин. Ты его любишь, но как близкого друга. — Что ты такое… — Я слышу это. Сейчас — очень отчётливо. Карин вспомнила тёплые невесомые ленты, проскользнувшие по рукам и к сердцу. «Ах, вот оно что…» Захотелось истерично засмеяться. Так невыносимо захотелось, что пришлось прятать лицо в ладонях, укрываясь ими как щитом, чтобы успокоиться хотя бы на пару секунд. Нервы, душа — высоковольтные оголённые провода. Как же она зла на этого белобрысого чёрта, кто бы знал. Как он посмел появиться, именно когда жизнь уже почти наладилась? Как он посмел парой фраз разбить её защиту и довести до края?! Как она посмела полюбить человека до невыносимой боли в груди, до покалывающих игл в пальцах от желания обнять в ответ, до треклятых слёз, будь они неладны, до полуночного бреда, до в хлам сбившегося дыхания и полной перегрузки мыслей, откуда он больше не найдёт выхода? Вдох, выдох. «Соберись, тряпка. Хоть последние остатки гордости не теряй!» — В самый ужасный период жизни он буквально спас меня, вытащил из депрессии, поддержал и помог вернуть мне себя. За это я бесконечно ему благодарна, но… — тяжёлый прерывистый вздох разрезал монолог. — Но вышла я за него замуж, потому что не видела причин отказываться. Нам комфортно друг с другом, и я считаю… считала, что этого достаточно для той жизни, которой всегда хотела. Этого бы хватило на столетие вперёд! Похоронить все эмоции и чувства, начать жить ради новых. И сейчас пришёл ты, всё усложнил до невозможности и… Сил говорить у Карин не осталось, равно как и стоять. Тоширо едва успел подхватить оседающую на пол девушку. «Позорница. Прощай, гордость.» Больше никто из них не говорил. Сидя на деревянной дорожке, занесённой песком, прислонившись к отсыревшим деревянным балкам, они задыхались в солёном воздухе моря и тепле друг друга. В голове постепенно прояснялось. *** Колокольчик над дверью радостно зазвенел, впуская в слегка душное помещение порцию свежего воздуха. Великолепные ароматы еды вокруг ежесекундно напоминали, что Карин не ела почти с самого утра. Не считая двух сильнейших стрессов за один день, она искренне удивлялась, как ещё стоит на ногах. А, погодите… — Карин-чан, мы здесь! — Санаэ! Иду! По дороге к столику в голове навязчиво крутились две глобальные цели: поесть и поговорить. И коли без первого не будет второго, то девушка решила от души насладиться вечером в её честь. Наверное, последним вечером, когда отголоски жизни, что была у неё ещё этим утром, окончательно не растворились во мраке грядущей ночи. *** На резных часах ручной работы, висевших у основания потолка прямо по центру стены, где покоились и другие предметы декора, пробил час ночи. Заведение пустело на глазах. Подруги Карин разошлись ещё в десятом часу вечера, ибо семейные обязанности их малолетние дети сами, увы, не осилят. Оставшись вдвоём с Ясуо, она в очередной раз увлеклась разговорами про учёбу, работу и футбол, едва не забыв, зачем она пришла на самом деле, и лишь старинные часы со звуком ненавязчиво вернули мысли в нужное русло. Отставив бокал с вином, Карин с тяжким вздохом сначала вперила бесконечно-печальный взгляд куда-то в район верхней пуговицы белоснежной рубашки мужа, а затем плавно перевела на лицо. — Что-то случилось, дорогая? «Чуткий, как и всегда.» — Да. Случилось. По спине мужчины прошёл неприятный холодок. Так тихо и обречённо прозвучали слова, это невозможно было не заметить. В самом деле, она никогда за всё время их знакомства не была настолько серьёзной. Сознание тревожно забило в колокола, будто предчувствуя что-то. Разговор предстоял явно не из лёгких. — По пути сюда… Случилось невозможное. Такое даже нарочно не придумаешь, Ясуо. — И поэтому ты весь вечер была сама не своя? Карин, с тобой всё в порядке? — Нет, Ясуо. Нет. Не в порядке. Я сошла с ума за каких-то жалких пять минут. И теперь мне так стыдно перед тобой, до невообразимости… Вымученная улыбка любимой — как ножом по сердцу. Неопределённый страх начал лизать пятки, мириады причин проскакивали в голове за доли секунды и постепенно лишали здравомыслия. — Пожалуйста, скажи прямо, иначе сейчас сойду с ума я, от беспокойства. — Ясуо, я… Кажется, я больше не могу обманывать ни себя, ни тебя. Я искренне пыталась отдаться отношениям с тобой, стать единым целым, но… — на этом моменте колючий ком предательски подкатил к горлу. — Не торопись, я слушаю. Мелкая, едва уловимая дрожь в голосе мужчины не ускользнула от чуткого слуха девушки, но обратной дороги уже не было: всё уничтожил одним своим существованием один конкретный человек. — Вот же ж, даже сейчас ты умудряешься быть учтивым и внимательным! — тяжкий вздох ослабил напряжение, даря возможность говорить адекватно ещё некоторое время. — Ясуо, что ты знаешь о единении душ? Вопрос, мягко говоря, застал врасплох. Даже зная, что в семье Куросаки живёт весьма чудной народ, он никогда не думал, что тема духов и прочих сверхъестественных сущностей когда-нибудь коснётся непосредственно его самого. Он весьма озадаченно спросил: — Когда люди живут душа в душу? Как одно целое? Карин, ты же имеешь в виду нечто иное, верно? — Да. — Если это снова твои духовные приколы, то… — Это не мои духовные приколы, Ясуо! Не я придумала это понятие и не мне его изменять! Оно либо есть, либо его нет. — В таком случае прости за резкость. Просто не могу понять одну вещь: разве у нас его нет? Единения. Горькая улыбка стала первым гвоздём в крышку гроба. — Прости меня. Прости, если сможешь. Приложив ладонь ко лбу, она впервые за разговор отвела взгляд в стол, в очередной раз проигрывая сражению со слезами, которые окончательно стали неуправляемыми. — Я люблю его больше жизни. И хоть голос любимой жены был едва слышен, он чётко и ясно услышал свой приговор, разом вколотивший оставшиеся гвозди. Картинка сложилась как никогда цельно, обрывки воспоминаний и разговоров о прошлом сплелись в один лоскут, бонусом подбрасывая в голову случайно увиденные однажды скетчи светловолосого и до неприличия красивого юноши. Слова были излишни. Сердце будто ухнуло вниз, оставляя за собой зияющую дыру. Крови не было, боли не было. Пустота, такая всепожирающая и стремительная, что слабели конечности. Железная вилка с тихим звоном упала на багровый ковёр. *** Утренний свет юрко скользил по комнате, стараясь добраться до каждого укромного уголка: с тумбочки на рабочий стол, со стола на гардеробную, а с неё уже на широкую двуспальную кровать. Громкие зевки прозвучали почти одновременно, когда лучики солнца мазнули по коже и лицу, невольно пробуждая ото сна. Девушка и юноша сладко потянулись на смятых простынях, когда последний внезапно затянул первую в уютные объятия, и приятный короткий поцелуй задал весь настрой на день грядущий. — С добрым утром, саншайн. — С добрым утром, первоклашка. Воздух комнаты насквозь пропитался пряностями, зелёным чаем и сладким послевкусием. Примечание Сакунами - \"Цветущие волны\", город на побережье, на севере от Каракуры.

Буду хранить его как зеницу ока! Звонкий голос ласкал слух и разливался теплом по телу, будто горячий чай в зимнюю стужу. Губы сами собой растянулись в улыбке, а руки, тоже сами собой, затянули в объятия. — Уж постарайся. Он не просто для красоты, поскольку это твой барьер и память в одном флаконе. — Это как? — недоумение Карин можно было считать закрытыми глазами, если бы потребовалось. Сдержать снисходительного смешка капитан не смог. — Барьер — на экстренные случаи. Пустые не будут тебя беспокоить, пока ты его не снимешь или не захочешь самостоятельно ослабить действие магии. Память же объясняется просто: медальон считывает ауру, настроение, сны и образы мыслей, записывая их на встроенный носитель. Как камера, но духовных материй. — Ого, что-то запредельно внушительное… А второе мне зачем? — Чтобы ничего не забывала, конечно же. Стоит тебе его открыть потайной кнопкой, как все записанные фрагменты вернутся обратно в сознание. Очень удобная штука. В голове возникли первые ростки сомнения. Нетипичное поведение, памятный подарок, странные разговоры и улыбка, что лучезарнее солнца в ясный зимний день… Он что, прощается с ней? «Да нет, быть такого не может». Ростки были агрессивно задушены уверенностью: если Тоширо что-то делает, то никогда — просто так. Видимо, активность пустых в городе снова выросла, или работы в Готее прибавилось настолько, что увидятся они снова ещё нескоро и таким образом он заботится об её безопасности, а запись жизни в медальон в принципе интересная технология, испытать которую Карин совершенно не против. А вытащить из него подробности она ещё успеет. В конце концов, память — это всё, что с нами остаётся, уходит от нас и от нас остаётся. Разменная монета в гача-автомате, с первой и единственной попыткой спасти и унести с собой в Сансару. Всегда ва-банк. — Действительно универсальный… гаджет. Гаджет ведь? И хотя с памятью у меня всё прекрасно, в будущем это может стать палочкой-выручалочкой. Высокоуровневая духовная технология или что-то около того? — Она самая. Схватываешь на лету. — Интересно, заменит ли она ваши смартфоны в будущем… — На самом деле капитан Куротсучи уже вовсю работает над модернизацией устройства. — Что ж, такими темпами и до смарт-часов доберётесь: видят боги, недалёк тот день! — Карин задорно рассмеялась и ответила на объятия крепче обычного, утыкаясь носом в выемку косодэ с оголённой кожей, что чуть ниже привычного глазу лазурного цвета шарфа. Тепло в теле юного капитана десятого отряда сменилось на «горячо» как по щелчку пальцев, немного испугав. Тоширо молился, чтобы она не заметила. Каждый раз, каждый раз она умудрялась сделать что-то непостижимое уму, телу, чувствам, и каждый раз — случайность, граничащая с фатальностью. Для него так точно. Неловкую идиллию прервала отвратительно звонкая мелодия из смартфона Тоширо, и судя по безнадёжному выражению лица, звонил кто-то, с кем дела иметь он точно не горит желанием. — Хирако, какого чёрта… Что ж, думаю, на сегодня всё, работа не ждёт. Береги себя. — Погоди-погоди, секундочку! — Карин едва успела схватиться за полы хаори и остановить парня от перехода в Сенкаймон и в ответ получила вопросительный взгляд. — Ты же не показал, как именно считывать воспоминания. — А, точно, — капитан спрыгнул на землю, как ни в чём не бывало, и в один шаг сократил между ними расстояние до критического уровня, на выдохе соприкоснувшись с губами девушки. Озорная улыбка вновь тронула лицо, и Тоширо, наблюдая за оторопевшей и враз растопившейся Карин, ловко развернул медальон обратной стороной и указал на едва заметную кнопочку под корпусом с подвижными частями: стоило её нажать, как едва видимая беловатая позёмка потянулась к лицу, будто обдавая неким ароматом… Перед глазами тотчас же мелькнула картинка событий минутной давности, оказавшись красочнее и ярче настоящей. Неужели она всё видит именно так? — Сумасшедший. — От такой же слышу-у-у, — нараспев протянул капитан и пожал плечами. — Ты смотри осторожней, я могу вернуть первоклашку в оборот в любой момент, — такой подставы от Карин он явно не ожидал, наспех состряпав возмущённую рожицу. — Эй! В ответ снова заливистый смех, от которого внезапно сильно кольнуло где-то в области сердца. Задор вмиг потух, оставив на поверхности вязкий привкус чего-то… Далёкого, едва забытого. «Я не готов». — К слову, присмотрись внимательнее к медальону-то. — Я что-то упустила? — Кто знает… Ох уж эта его фирменная фраза… Вроде и бесила, а вроде и не очень. Карин хотела убедиться в сказанном и повернула медальон лицевой стороной к себе. Медленно и трепетно раскрыла крылья, под которыми — внезапно — прятались вытесненные серебром слова. «You’re my Sunshine». От нахлынувших чувств хотелось разрыдаться прямо здесь и сейчас. Как она могла не заметить этого?! Как могла сомневаться в нём? Ответ вот же он, на ладони, сейчас, буквально. Как же тепло. Вот бы этот миг длился вечность. *** После недельного отпуска и последующего возвращения Хицугаи Тоширо в Общество Душ, привычный мир Куросаки Карин вновь начал обнимать со всех сторон. Подготовка к поступлению в ВУЗ плавно перетекала в обязанности медсестры в клинике отца; иногда оставалось время на дружеские футбольные матчи и тренировки на крытых площадках со старой гвардией бессменных товарищей детства и даже на посиделки с подругами в уютных кофейнях. Раз в неделю она виделась с племянником (чему была очень рада) и училась азам кулинарии у Юзу. Всё это очень захватывало внимание, затягивало в пучину реальности, где нет почти места чему-то нематериальному, духовному. Удивительное дело, но, кажется, барьер медальона действительно работал — назойливых духов в доме заметно поубавилось, они больше не докучали Карин своим чрезмерным вниманием, скорее даже наоборот: сторонились и тихо ворчали. Что ж, лишний груз — долой с плеч. И всё же, во всей этой бытовой суматохе ей частенько удавалось общаться с Тоширо не только в мессенджере, но и с помощью видео-аудио звонков. В силу занятости разговоры были недолгими, но приятными и согревающими долгими зимними вечерами. Казалось, этого вполне достаточно для счастья, что теплилось маленьким подсолнухом под рёбрами и холодило металлом ключицы. Казалось, он вот-вот снова спустится в Генсей, хотя бы на денёк, расскажет всё с глазу на глаз и во всех подробностях, вновь спонтанно предложит место, которое хотел бы посетить вместе с ней, вновь обнимет крепко-крепко посреди футбольного поля и скажет то, что давно вертится на языке у обоих… Казалось, у этого сна нет конца. Она резко подорвалась на кровати, даже толком не успев раскрыть глаз. В холодном поту, дрожащая как осиновый лист, с тяжёлым и громким дыханием, Карин на ощупь стала искать стакан воды, который всегда ставила на ночь на такие случаи. Осушив его за три больших глотка, она зашлась в резком кашле: пить воду такими порциями было плохой идеей. — Карин, что случилось? — приглушённый заботливый и слегка встревоженный голос с другой части кровати в полусне пытался понять происходящее. — В-всё нормаль… кхе-кхе, нормально, водой подавилась, бывает. — Тебе помочь? — голос стал ближе: обладатель незаметно переполз на её часть и попытался растереть кожу меж лопатками, но его мягко остановила едва дрожащая рука. — Нет-нет, не нужно этого делать, уже прошло почти. Всё хорошо, правда. Только испугалась немного, пойду, подышу свежим воздухом. — Хорошо. Если буду нужен — зови, — громко зевая, мужчина переполз обратно на свою территорию, подмял под шею подушку и мгновенно унёсся в страну грёз, ибо работу по понедельникам ещё никто, к великому сожалению, не отменял. — Нужен… Ох, если б ты знал… — полушёпот отозвался остаточным першением в горле, которое тотчас заставило замолчать. Карин медленно и наугад шаркала тапочками в сторону любимой лоджии, где её ждали почти полная луна, тишина ночного города и мягкое кресло. Когда голова раскалывается на части, а щёки сушатся от солёной влаги, она всегда там: в любой сезон, в любую погоду. Стоило стеклянной двери отъехать в сторону, как на девушку обрушился нескончаемый поток ноябрьского воздуха. Ненужные мысли выветрились при первом порыве ледяного ветра, позволяя слабой улыбке появиться на лице. Однако стоило Карин начать вспоминать сон, как всё наглым образом возвратилось на круги своя, отдаваясь пульсирующей болью в висках. «Это снова был он». Очертания во сне так расплывались, что она с трудом могла бы вспомнить даже малую часть его образа. Мысли скомкались. Рука непроизвольно потянулась к медальону, который она упрямо продолжала носить, но шальная мысля тотчас же была загашена силой воли. «Забыла же, отпустила… И что в итоге? Триумфальное возвращение к самоедству и бесполезному анализу, прекрасно. Докатились, Карин, конечная. Дальше только дурка», — невесёлые мысли текли ручьём в лунном свете приморского городка Сакунами, постепенно разветвляясь на поворотах и утекая сквозь пальцы ввысь, вслед за ветром. В какой-то момент ей тоже захотелось стать этим ручейком: маленьким, незаметным. Она смогла бы улететь ввысь и узнать у своих братьев-ручейков о делах, творящихся в мире ином. Послушать сплетни, посмеяться, ужаснуться, поплакать и вновь засмеяться. Улыбнуться, успокоиться и плавно спланировать вниз, в родной дом, где тебя любят и ждут. Славное путешествие бы вышло, скажи? Ветер задул сильнее. В носу что-то закололо. Холодало. «К чёрту это всё. Тревоги и слёзы остались в прошлой жизни, разве нет? Ты себе обещала, так выполняй обещание!», — слегка воодушевлённая, бывшая Куросаки резко шмыгнула носом, вернулась в тёплую комнату и задвинула дверь обратно, оставляя за порогом всё то, что отравляло ей существование. Настала пора окончательно проснуться. *** Сегодня был последний день государственных выпускных экзаменов в ВУЗе, где Карин провела без малого шесть лет. Остатки мандража всё ещё аукались в напряжённых мышцах рук и в районе лопаток, но самое страшное теперь позади. Результаты будут нескоро, а потому и волноваться уже не было смысла. Карин глубоко вздохнула и медленно выдохнула, позволяя уставшей улыбке забрать любые волнения и сомнения. Она — выпускница. Один из самых важных и ярких жизненных этапов — позади. От одной этой мысли с ума можно сойти! В кармане кашемирового пальто шоколадного оттенка завибрировал смартфон, следом раздался звонок. — Алло. — Ну что, сдала? Дорогая, как себя чувствуешь? — Словно пёрышко! Которое окунули в смолу и пытались заставить лететь. — Ха-ха-ха, понимаю! В своё время тоже на выпускных был выжат как лимон. Главное теперь не думать о результатах и порадовать себя за проделанную работу, так ведь? — Определённо. Постой, хочешь сказать, ты всё уже устроил? — Не только я! Твои подруги, Макото и Санаэ, тоже участвовали. — Как, и без меня?! — Так ты же тесты писала и диплом защищала… — А… Точно. Забыла. Уже. Звонкий смех раздался по ту сторону экрана. — Понял, понял. Ладно, ты не задерживайся, у нас тут пир горой намечается! Локацию я уже скинул, не забудь предупредить, как подъедешь. — Хорошо, дорогой, спасибо тебе. За всё. Правда, спасибо! — Ты не разведёшь меня этим на слёзы, ты не разведёшь меня этим на слё… ай к чёрту, довела! Карин, что ты творишь? — Ясуо, я же от души! — бывшая Куросаки очень старалась не смеяться во весь голос, но получалось из рук вон плохо: прохожие недоумённо поглядывали на абсолютно счастливую девушку, однако той будто бы и всё равно на самом деле. — Я рад. Очень. Всё, жду звонка. Бай! Короткие гудки на линии красноречиво говорили о нетерпении Ясуо как можно скорее воссоединиться с женой и разделить важный и невероятно радостный момент её жизни. Карин улыбнулась своим мыслям ещё шире и бодро зашагала вперёд. Спустя какое-то время шаг сбился, и Карин уже неспешно брела в сторону отмеченной локации: муж любил открывать новые грани города вместе с ней, и поскольку переехали они из Каракуры относительно недавно, узнать новое пристанище получше и со всех сторон было банальной необходимостью. Между прочим, приятной! Тут никаких тебе криков и вечных препираний брата с отцом, взбудораженных возгласов Юзу на каждый чих со стороны потенциальных кавалеров своей сестры, беготни племянника с друзьями по всему дому, отвратительнейших духов и призраков всех мастей и пород, которые в какой-то момент почему-то вновь заполонили дом… А ещё никаких пьяных криков Ренджи, Иккаку, Рукии-сан и Рангику-сан, которые активно захаживали к Ичи-нии побазарить за жизнь и заодно попробовать вытащить того погулять семейными компаниями на свет божий, иначе, со слов той же Рукии-сан, тот «совсем превратится из домоседа в хиккана, а так хоть траву потрогает». И где только она понабралась новомодных словечек?.. К счастью, заведение оказалось недалеко: если верить карте, двадцать минут неспешной ходьбы и девушка на месте. Приятным бонусом служило то, что часть пути пролегала по выделенной дорожке вдоль берега Японского моря, откуда порывистый ветер гнал свинцовые серые тучи, влагу и солёный воздух. Порой он свирепел, трепля слои одежды из стороны в сторону, будто желая утащить их с собой на дно морское вместе с хозяйкой. Да и в целом погода сегодня будто вторила её душе: такой же растрёпанной, уставшей, но с оптимизмом смотрящей в будущее. На половине пути она резко почувствовала озноб. Пробирающий до кончиков пальцев, вызывающий стройный табун мурашек по загривку, шее, и дальше змейками уползая под лопатки. Следом раздался негромкий чих. «Никак простыть успела? Ага, конечно, я — и простыть по такому пустяку? Не в этой жизни». Тут что-то другое. Такое знакомое, такое… родное? Карин поёжилась и обхватила плечи руками: озноб будто пронзал саму душу. «Эта реацу…» Стоило ей отвернуть голову от морского пейзажа в поисках источника холода, как голова вдруг запульсировала тупой болью в висках, совсем как в нынешнюю беспокойную ночь. Картинка перед глазами на мгновение поплыла: на переносицу излишне давили носоупоры, и декоративные очки пришлось снять. Правда, легче от этого не стало, потому что видение никуда не делось. Привет из прошлого, который она боялась встретить больше всего на свете, сейчас стоит прямо перед ней. Подросший, на вид смертельно уставший, но всё такой же растрёпанный и миловидный. В горле мгновенно пересохло. Будь её воля, выпила бы она всё море до дна. — Т-ты… — Карин потребовалась вся дремлющая в ней сила воли, чтобы сглотнуть тугой ком, что так некстати подкатил прямо к языку, и продолжить смотреть в бессовестные глаза цвета лазурного моря. Странное дело, ведь раньше её невозможно было так быстро развести на эмоции, а тут… — Не ожидал найти тебя здесь, — голос, что почти не изменился со дня их последней встречи, немного сел и едва заметно дрогнул. В нём было столько… печали? Безнадёги? Облегчения? Тихой радости? Она не могла распознать сходу. — И я тоже. Давно не виделись, Тоширо. «Как там говорили? Сколько от прошлого ни беги, оно обязательно настигнет и застанет врасплох? Что за придурок придумал эту концепцию? Хочу от души дать ему в рожу! И не смей разводить сырость, слышишь? Не смей, только не сейчас!» — вопреки беспорядочным мыслям, Карин вымученно улыбнулась. В области сердца тотчас же кольнуло и тяжко заныло. — Да… давно. Оба одновременно отвели взгляд в сторону, воцарилось неловкое и тяжёлое молчание. Пять лет — не много и не мало, если так посмотреть. Для него — будто месяц промелькнул, для неё — бесконечная вереница дней в глухой тиши собственного мира, в котором солёные реки впадали в солёное море, бесконечный горизонт упирался в острые углы, а пресловутая реальность держала в бесконечно глубоком сне, полном счастья и жизни. Но стоило лишь на секунду заглянуть в эти глаза, стоило лишь на секунду дать слабину, как небо вдруг пошло глубокими трещинами, вода в море вскипела, а счастье, что Карин крепко держала в руках, беззвучно рассыпалось, развеялось прахом по ветру. Вот так просто — раз! — и всё. Слабачка, не сумевшая усмирить пропитанные насквозь -его- запахом мысли и эмоции. Пряности, зелёный чай и сладкое послевкусие — так она запомнила его объятия пять лет назад и абсолютно такой же запах витал сейчас рядом с ней. Мир вдруг схлопнулся и сузился до неё, свистящего ветра в ушах и вечно взъерошенного шинигами напротив. Да, пожалуй, она наконец проснулась. — Ты здесь по делам Готея? — Карин медленно подошла к деревянному ограждению, что сопровождало её весь нынешний путь, облокотилась о перила и устремила взгляд в беспокойное море. Не хотелось начинать издалека, но слова сами слетели с губ. — Если я скажу «да», ты поверишь? — за спиной едва заметно шевельнулись полы белоснежного хаори. Послышался шорох варадзи, и пряности оказались совсем рядышком, нагло ударяя в нос. Тоширо почти в точности повторил позу девушки, вставая едва плечом к плечу. Сейчас у него не было абсолютно никакого права украдкой разглядывать её лицо, поэтому взгляд также блуждал по морским гребням волн. — Знаешь, Сакунами хоть и соседствует по северной стороне от Каракуры, но местных духов здесь раз-два и обчёлся, все абсолютно безвредные. Тех редких пустых, появляющихся от силы раза два за месяц, успевают уничтожить ещё до того, как человек вроде меня что-либо вообще поймёт. Капитаны же, насколько мне известно, спускаются на грунт либо по особым заданиям вроде патруля, либо по личным делам. Кроме того, Сакунами вроде как вообще не под твоей юрисдикцией, поэтому нет, не поверю. — Так и думал, от тебя ничего не утаишь — сбоку послышался тяжёлый вздох. — На самом деле мне потребовалось время, чтобы разузнать, где тебя искать. — Даже не буду спрашивать зачем, но могу предположить, что папаша мой слил всё как на духу, да? — уха коснулась горькая усмешка. — Абсолютно. Я не просил, но Ишшина было не заткнуть. — Вот как… — Карин аккуратно заправила прядь волос за ухо и замолчала. Мысли, мысли, мысли и ещё миллион таких же водили хороводы, прыгали друг через друга, наслаивались и растворялись в кислоте эмоций одна за другой. Слов не осталось, их забрал ветер, передавая эстафету снежному юноше рядом, скатываясь на языке в ожидании… чего? Извинений? Оправданий? Ничего из этого даже близко не перекроет тот злополучный период жизни, когда она была на короткой ноге с пограничными состояниями, и у края уже заманчиво зияла бездонная дыра с депрессией, соблазняя прыгнуть в неё с каждым днём всё сильнее. На самом деле действительно было интересно услышать причины столь внезапного, нахрен, исчезновения из её жизни, однако капитан не особо спешил раскрывать все карты, и это почему-то раздражало. — Карин, я… Мне столько нужно тебе сказать, но я даже не могу понять с чего начать… — тяжесть его слов грузом ложилась на сердце, поднимая тем самым внутри волну праведного гнева. — А, ну ты подумай тогда, мы вроде не спешим. Лет пять в запасе точно ещё есть. Вкрадчиво, отстранённо, слишком холодно. Ох. Едкий укол попадает точно в сердце, выбивая на мгновение весь воздух из лёгких и едва не подкашивает ноги. Хорошо, что под руками была опора. Из кармана пальто послышалась приятная мелодия звонка. Карин незамедлительно вытянула смартфон и подняла трубку. — Да? Да, я скоро буду, решила немного прогуляться. Ничего, если слегка подзадержусь? Да, пожалуйста. Спасибо, до встречи, — она уже как наяву видит перед собой беспокойные лица девочек и Ясуо, которые наверняка распознали натянуто-дружелюбный тон разговора и ждут от неё ответов. Но ответов они, скорее всего, не услышат. Настоящих — никогда. Не так поймут. — Тебя, видимо, заждались. Могу проводить? Карин оторопела от услышанного. Грешным делом подумала на слуховые галлюцинации. Резко развернулась, хлестанув по лицу угольно-чёрными прядями волос и отчаянно старалась заглянуть в эти нахальные глаза, что так же отчаянно бегали от неё. — Ты, должно быть, шутишь… — уголок губ девушки нервно задёргался. — Ты же шутишь, да? Знаешь, это охренеть как не смешно, потому что меня не нужно провожать, мне нужны ответы! Ответы, Тоширо, слышишь?! — Карин вспыхнула словно спичка. Хватая капитана за грудки, сминая хаори и косодэ, она силой пыталась вытрясти из него хоть что-то кроме сочувствия и виноватого-во-всех-грехах-тона-голоса. — Почему ты так внезапно исчез, почему не отвечал ни по каким коммуникациям, избегал меня, почему не сдержал обещание, почему-почему-почему?! За что ты так со мной… — от крика она сорвала голос, и последние слова вышли слишком задушенными собственным отчаянием. Капитан, ожидаемо, даже не шелохнулся: куда уж ей там тягаться с ним в силе, однако действие возымело свой эффект. Нежно перехватывая холодную руку своими широкими и шершавыми ладонями, он тихо подносит её к самому сердцу. Карин невольно задержала дыхание и почувствовала, как под ладонью гулко пульсирует рваный ритм и тепло, будто исходившее из самой души, невидимой лентой тянулось к ней по руке — от сердца к сердцу. Свободная рука невольно потянулась к медальону. Одно движение — и он наконец раскрылся, спустя долгих пять лет ожидания проецируя на маленький воздушный экран всё, что она успела пережить за эти годы: взлёты, падения, встречи, расставания, радости и горести, ожидания и обрушенную на бывшую Куросаки реальность. Всё как на ладони, без утайки. Когда краткий фильм закончился, Карин буквально на мгновение стало страшно поднимать голову, однако желание найти ответы на свои вопросы оказалось намного сильней. …И она наконец увидела. Всё перемололось, смешалось воедино, и теперь лишь одна невыразимая тоска плескалась на дне холодного океана. Это откровение так похоже отражало её саму, так неправильно сильно резонировало с его душой, что даже самые большие сомнения вопреки здравому смыслу стремительно испарялись. — Прости. Прости меня, пожалуйста, если сможешь когда-нибудь, — Тоширо мягко затянул девушку в объятия. Совсем как тогда. Она не смогла сопротивляться этому порыву. А впрочем, хотела ли? Так чертовски похоже, боже, просто до одури. Тепло мягко окутало плечи: будто время и пространство истёрли свои границы, будто никогда и не было этих пяти лет, будто прекрасный сон, что обернулся кошмаром, испарился без следа. Будто… — Возможно, у тебя действительно были веские причины так поступать, но… — Не пытайся меня оправдать, я этого не заслуживаю. Если ты уделишь мне ещё немного времени, то я всё объясню. Вообще всё. Отвечу на любой твой вопрос, каким бы сложным он ни был. Карин, прошу… — Тогда, пять лет назад даря этот кулон, ты действительно прощался… В глазах помутнело, тугой ком встал поперёк горла, в носу неприятно закололо — и вот уже бусины слёз бесконтрольно прокладывали себе дорожки на щеках, к шее и прямиком на тёмную ткань одеяния шинигами. Дыхание окончательно сбилось, очень быстро подводя к тихой истерике. — Все эти мучительно долгие пять лет… оно болело. Нестерпимо болело, но тогда я искренне думал, что поступаю правильно, что так будет лучше… — Лучше? Для кого лучше? Для меня, для тебя или для всех сразу? А просто спросить язык отсох? Ты хоть понимаешь, в какой ад успел меня загнать, каждый день каждого года пытая надежду до последнего вздоха? Ты понимаешь, что твои действия — это чистейшей воды эгоизм?! — Карин плакала. Навзрыд, как никогда сильно. Ей казалось, что все слёзы остались ещё в детстве на могиле матери, но этот человек в мгновение ока перевернул всё с ног на голову. Непростительное преступление и предательство своих идеалов. — Я считал, что когда отношения зайдут слишком далеко — а всё к этому и шло — начнутся проблемы далеко не бытового характера, о чём любезно напоминали едва ли не в каждом учебнике во времена академии — нельзя и всё тут. Запрет, нарушение которого могло повлечь за собой серьёзную опасность. Твои родители — тому пример… — голос шинигами подозрительно сел. — Считал, что тебе лучше вообще забыть меня, мир духов и шинигами с их заботами, как ты того и хотела в детстве, ведь тогда ты точно была бы в безопасности. В итоге, за мой эгоизм поплатились двое. — Считал, что лучше забыть? — за слух зацепились эти жалящие нутро слова. — Забыть… Да, знаешь, почти получилось, Тоширо, почти получилось! Ещё парочка дней — и ты бы остался призрачным школьным воспоминанием. А теперь… Что мне теперь делать? — Что мне теперь делать… — осипший вопрос почти потерялся в непрерывном потоке разбивающихся о берег волн. Казалось, они своими силами пытались заглушить боль двух израненных душ. Объятия вдруг будто стали чуть крепче, воздух — гуще, до ушей начал доноситься едва уловимый шёпот, а на макушку упало пару капель дождя. Постойте, дождя? Так ведь… — Знаешь, без тебя даже день казался мучительной вечностью во льдах. Это не дождь. Чтобы убедиться в открытии, Карин разомкнула кольцо тёплых рук, сделала шаг назад и взглянула в уголки глаз цвета бирюзы, где собрались капли солёной воды и одна за другой скатились по прекрасному лицу, сорвавшись с подбородка вниз, к земле. Тихо-тихо, капля за каплей подводили её к черте. Таким открытым и беззащитным он не был, пожалуй, никогда ещё в своей жизни. Сердце заныло пуще прежнего. — Тоширо, я же… Я же правда ждала. Поверила той дурацкой надписи на подсолнухе. До последнего ждала. Но теперь… — Действительно ли слишком поздно? Я знаю о твоём счастливом браке, но сейчас вижу совсем иную картину. Девушку бросило в дрожь. Перепутье жизни ещё никогда не настигало её с такой сумасшедшей скоростью, открывая только две дороги: «Сейчас» или «Никогда больше». Этот шинигами, кажется, узнал больше положенного. Чёрт возьми. — Я не могу бросить мужа вот так просто, не могу! Ты должен понимать, что такое клятва верности и… — ей не дали договорить. — Я понимаю. А ещё я понимаю, что такое синергия душ, Карин. Ты его любишь, но как близкого друга. — Что ты такое… — Я слышу это. Сейчас — очень отчётливо. Карин вспомнила тёплые невесомые ленты, проскользнувшие по рукам и к сердцу. «Ах, вот оно что…» Захотелось истерично засмеяться. Так невыносимо захотелось, что пришлось прятать лицо в ладонях, укрываясь ими как щитом, чтобы успокоиться хотя бы на пару секунд. Нервы, душа — высоковольтные оголённые провода. Как же она зла на этого белобрысого чёрта, кто бы знал. Как он посмел появиться, именно когда жизнь уже почти наладилась? Как он посмел парой фраз разбить её защиту и довести до края?! Как она посмела полюбить человека до невыносимой боли в груди, до покалывающих игл в пальцах от желания обнять в ответ, до треклятых слёз, будь они неладны, до полуночного бреда, до в хлам сбившегося дыхания и полной перегрузки мыслей, откуда он больше не найдёт выхода? Вдох, выдох. «Соберись, тряпка. Хоть последние остатки гордости не теряй!» — В самый ужасный период жизни он буквально спас меня, вытащил из депрессии, поддержал и помог вернуть мне себя. За это я бесконечно ему благодарна, но… — тяжёлый прерывистый вздох разрезал монолог. — Но вышла я за него замуж, потому что не видела причин отказываться. Нам комфортно друг с другом, и я считаю… считала, что этого достаточно для той жизни, которой всегда хотела. Этого бы хватило на столетие вперёд! Похоронить все эмоции и чувства, начать жить ради новых. И сейчас пришёл ты, всё усложнил до невозможности и… Сил говорить у Карин не осталось, равно как и стоять. Тоширо едва успел подхватить оседающую на пол девушку. «Позорница. Прощай, гордость.» Больше никто из них не говорил. Сидя на деревянной дорожке, занесённой песком, прислонившись к отсыревшим деревянным балкам, они задыхались в солёном воздухе моря и тепле друг друга. В голове постепенно прояснялось. *** Колокольчик над дверью радостно зазвенел, впуская в слегка душное помещение порцию свежего воздуха. Великолепные ароматы еды вокруг ежесекундно напоминали, что Карин не ела почти с самого утра. Не считая двух сильнейших стрессов за один день, она искренне удивлялась, как ещё стоит на ногах. А, погодите… — Карин-чан, мы здесь! — Санаэ! Иду! По дороге к столику в голове навязчиво крутились две глобальные цели: поесть и поговорить. И коли без первого не будет второго, то девушка решила от души насладиться вечером в её честь. Наверное, последним вечером, когда отголоски жизни, что была у неё ещё этим утром, окончательно не растворились во мраке грядущей ночи. *** На резных часах ручной работы, висевших у основания потолка прямо по центру стены, где покоились и другие предметы декора, пробил час ночи. Заведение пустело на глазах. Подруги Карин разошлись ещё в десятом часу вечера, ибо семейные обязанности их малолетние дети сами, увы, не осилят. Оставшись вдвоём с Ясуо, она в очередной раз увлеклась разговорами про учёбу, работу и футбол, едва не забыв, зачем она пришла на самом деле, и лишь старинные часы со звуком ненавязчиво вернули мысли в нужное русло. Отставив бокал с вином, Карин с тяжким вздохом сначала вперила бесконечно-печальный взгляд куда-то в район верхней пуговицы белоснежной рубашки мужа, а затем плавно перевела на лицо. — Что-то случилось, дорогая? «Чуткий, как и всегда.» — Да. Случилось. По спине мужчины прошёл неприятный холодок. Так тихо и обречённо прозвучали слова, это невозможно было не заметить. В самом деле, она никогда за всё время их знакомства не была настолько серьёзной. Сознание тревожно забило в колокола, будто предчувствуя что-то. Разговор предстоял явно не из лёгких. — По пути сюда… Случилось невозможное. Такое даже нарочно не придумаешь, Ясуо. — И поэтому ты весь вечер была сама не своя? Карин, с тобой всё в порядке? — Нет, Ясуо. Нет. Не в порядке. Я сошла с ума за каких-то жалких пять минут. И теперь мне так стыдно перед тобой, до невообразимости… Вымученная улыбка любимой — как ножом по сердцу. Неопределённый страх начал лизать пятки, мириады причин проскакивали в голове за доли секунды и постепенно лишали здравомыслия. — Пожалуйста, скажи прямо, иначе сейчас сойду с ума я, от беспокойства. — Ясуо, я… Кажется, я больше не могу обманывать ни себя, ни тебя. Я искренне пыталась отдаться отношениям с тобой, стать единым целым, но… — на этом моменте колючий ком предательски подкатил к горлу. — Не торопись, я слушаю. Мелкая, едва уловимая дрожь в голосе мужчины не ускользнула от чуткого слуха девушки, но обратной дороги уже не было: всё уничтожил одним своим существованием один конкретный человек. — Вот же ж, даже сейчас ты умудряешься быть учтивым и внимательным! — тяжкий вздох ослабил напряжение, даря возможность говорить адекватно ещё некоторое время. — Ясуо, что ты знаешь о единении душ? Вопрос, мягко говоря, застал врасплох. Даже зная, что в семье Куросаки живёт весьма чудной народ, он никогда не думал, что тема духов и прочих сверхъестественных сущностей когда-нибудь коснётся непосредственно его самого. Он весьма озадаченно спросил: — Когда люди живут душа в душу? Как одно целое? Карин, ты же имеешь в виду нечто иное, верно? — Да. — Если это снова твои духовные приколы, то… — Это не мои духовные приколы, Ясуо! Не я придумала это понятие и не мне его изменять! Оно либо есть, либо его нет. — В таком случае прости за резкость. Просто не могу понять одну вещь: разве у нас его нет? Единения. Горькая улыбка стала первым гвоздём в крышку гроба. — Прости меня. Прости, если сможешь. Приложив ладонь ко лбу, она впервые за разговор отвела взгляд в стол, в очередной раз проигрывая сражению со слезами, которые окончательно стали неуправляемыми. — Я люблю его больше жизни. И хоть голос любимой жены был едва слышен, он чётко и ясно услышал свой приговор, разом вколотивший оставшиеся гвозди. Картинка сложилась как никогда цельно, обрывки воспоминаний и разговоров о прошлом сплелись в один лоскут, бонусом подбрасывая в голову случайно увиденные однажды скетчи светловолосого и до неприличия красивого юноши. Слова были излишни. Сердце будто ухнуло вниз, оставляя за собой зияющую дыру. Крови не было, боли не было. Пустота, такая всепожирающая и стремительная, что слабели конечности. Железная вилка с тихим звоном упала на багровый ковёр. *** Утренний свет юрко скользил по комнате, стараясь добраться до каждого укромного уголка: с тумбочки на рабочий стол, со стола на гардеробную, а с неё уже на широкую двуспальную кровать. Громкие зевки прозвучали почти одновременно, когда лучики солнца мазнули по коже и лицу, невольно пробуждая ото сна. Девушка и юноша сладко потянулись на смятых простынях, когда последний внезапно затянул первую в уютные объятия, и приятный короткий поцелуй задал весь настрой на день грядущий. — С добрым утром, саншайн. — С добрым утром, первоклашка. Воздух комнаты насквозь пропитался пряностями, зелёным чаем и сладким послевкусием. Примечание Сакунами - \"Цветущие волны\", город на побережье, на севере от Каракуры.
