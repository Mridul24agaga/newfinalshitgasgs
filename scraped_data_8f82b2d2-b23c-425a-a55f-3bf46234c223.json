  "initialResearchSummary": "Alright, let’s dive into this URL you threw at me, https://automatetube.com/. So right off the bat, the name “Automate Tube” gives off some solid vibes that it’s about automating something related to video or multimedia. You know, like those classic tubes of content we’re all glued to—YouTube, Vimeo, whatever floats your boat. I'm betting this site is all about making the video experience smoother and easier. Maybe it’s a tool that helps creators automate their uploads, manage their channels, or even optimize their video content for better visibility. Think along the lines of scheduling posts, automating thumbnails, or crafting catchy titles that draw viewers in. It’s like having a little mini assistant to do the heavy lifting while you enjoy life or make more content. Then again, it could also be focused on analyzing video performance. Like, you know those analytics dashboards that tell you who's watching, when they're tuning in, and how long they stick around? My guess is Automate Tube might offer some kind of automation for those insights—the kind of stuff that makes creators feel like they’ve got their fingers on the pulse of their audience without diving into the nitty-gritty every single day. If we’re thinking broader, maybe it has something to do with automating video playlists or managing subscriptions. Imagine being able to set up custom playlists that refresh automatically based on viewer trends or popular content. That way, when people come to your channel, they’re hit with fresh stuff every time, and you don’t have to lift a finger. Now, let's not forget about the community aspect! There could be a social element where creators can share their automation strategies or learn from one another—kind of like a digital watering hole for video makers. Maybe they have forums or blogs that break down the best practices for harnessing the power of automation effectively. And hey, if they’re savvy, they might also touch on monetization strategies—automating ad placements or optimizing content for revenue generation. You know how it is; everyone’s trying to squeeze a little more out of their content, and if Automate Tube can help users do that, they’d definitely have a winner on their hands. In a nutshell, it feels like Automate Tube is set up to simplify life for video creators. Whether through automation tools, analytics, community insights, or even monetization tips, the goal seems to be about enabling creators to focus more on what they love—making awesome videos—while taking away some of the less exciting, time-consuming tasks. So yeah, that’s the vibe I’m getting from the name and that URL. Definitely a space where tech meets creativity, aimed at taking some of the grunt work out of the video-making game. Cheers to that!",

We break it all down in our new podcast. After you click the button below hit the “Listen On Apple Podcasts” link and subscribe to discover the truth. Listen Now Many of us are already well-versed in making videos, exercising technique with creativity; to highlight original content and unique style. What we could use, happily; are a few pointers on how to make video editing a breeze. Okay, so you don’t have to edit videos yourself. That’s where you can count on Vidchops, yet it’s always good to know so you can have these in mind for reference and understanding. Sure, there are many tips and tricks floating around online, mixed with our own varied feelings on whether or not these pointers are ‘fool-proof’ or not. Below are 10 things that you can rest assured will help you in truly making video editing a breeze. Getting Organized This may sound cliché but still true. GET ORGANIZED. We all have met that someone who is found behind a desk full of loose papers and whatnot, claiming to be organized. To truly get the best benefits from easy breezy video editing, you really need to get organized. To help you with the basics, below are a few key factors you need to cover before beginning with any kind of video edit. Some projects may require more detail than others but it all begins here. Do you have the following points sorted? Footage Project Files Graphics Audio Images Start with shortcuts Sure, we’ve all heard of how success has no shortcuts but in this case, you can really count on this factor as a game-changer when on the subject of video editing. There is a complete keyboard shortcuts guide available that will help you streamline the editing process but also save precious time, to be used in a more productive fashion. Still not sure about this? Try using the ‘L’ button on your keyboard and watch it speed up your playback time. Awesome! Isn’t it? Don’t forget Music and SFX What shortcuts are to speeding up your video editing process, music and sound effects are to adding depth and layering to your videos dramatically. No matter what the subject or style, you can find music and sound effects to match just about anything. For music, all you have to think of is whether or not your music matches your visuals. For instance, mixing a groovy dance track with a mellow or serious mood would stick out like a sore thumb. On a side-note, make sure you cut the correct beat and bit of the song to fit the particular sequence. A well-timed cut to any beat can be anything from iconic to forgettable. The same applies to sound effects as well. Using such elements as crowd noises, background sounds and other subtle yet noticeable cues help the audience to feel like they’re really experiencing everything that they’re watching. Surely, you may have seen many behind-the-scenes videos where such things as music or sound-effects are not cued in real time. That’s because they’re all done in post-production. Speed it Up or Down… When dealing with action sequences, speed ramping is involved. This basically means that something or someone in the scene needs to be emphasized in either fast or slow motion. This is not only used for action sequences but anything that requires a contrast using highlights that emphasizes a person, thing or action. Think of the movements in the Matrix. You have to, however, make sure that it all looks natural and matches well with the overall scene. For Premiere: You can ramp your clip by right-clicking on your clip in the sequence and selecting Show Clip Key Frames > Time re-mapping > Speed. The line on the clip will now represent the timing, and if you create markers (Command-click on Mac or Control-click on PC), you can move those markers to increase or decrease the duration between them. For Final Cut X: You can ramp by selecting your range within your clip (or the complete clip), clicking the Re-Time menu popup below the viewer and selecting > to 0% for slow motion or > from 0% to speed it up. Source It’s Cool to Cover it Up It really is, cool to cover it up. Especially when editing interviews that seem to linger or drag on to eternity. The best thing you can do is try adding some b-roll or a+b roll to keep it interesting and flowing naturally, with the rest of the content. What you can also do, is cut back to the person who is talking if they’re saying something important or vital to the overall understanding of a message. Don’t linger, however, too long before cutting away simply for the sake of breaking up the monotony. If you’ve conducted or shot a lot of interviews, you would know that many people tend to use lots of ‘um’ ‘uh’ or ‘you know’ which may not be attractive in a final video edit. Especially if there’s excessive use of such breaks. Another element could also be rambling. When a person tends to repeat an already mentioned piece of information. Some Dramatic Effect via Spacing it Out You can make your video flow authentically by adding footage to either cover up cuts, as talked about above, or for transitioning to another idea or location. This technique will really add some professionally added drama to your content. Make your subject’s powerful statements standout more by allowing some degree of breathing room. Where the viewer can reflect on what they’ve just heard or seen. Keep the visuals going by not stopping the a-roll and let the music or visual aid the pause by increasing the volume or placing the perfect visual cap on the soundbite. This is also a good example for highlighting statements while allowing a breathing minute which contains wonderful graphics or tunes to enhance the story. And Now the Stabilizer… Aside from bad quality sound, having distorted or wobbly footage is a death sentence for not just your video but the one who will edit it. The good news is, you can find many great plug-ins and tools that will stabilize your footage and some, that are even built-into your editing software. Being hands-on in this particular area is a must, as overcoming this factor can also be a game-changer as well. From Warp Stabilizer in Adobe Premiere/ After Effects and SmoothCam in Final Cut X are a couple of big names that will not let you down. Especially regarding this crucial aspect of video editing. Some powerful third-party plugins are ReelSteady that works really well in After Effects, as well as apps that stabilize your phone video that includes Emulsion. You Can if you Want to … Re-Frame it Cameras now have the ability to shoot higher resolutions than before, which enables editors to re-frame and push or pull the footage to create interesting effects. Since 1080p is still the standard delivery resolution across many job markets, you have a wide space to explore with 2k and above resolutions. Whether a subtle push-in during a tense scene or to position your subject in the center of the frame if their eye-line is off are just a couple of things you can do, working within this domain. You can even get two shots out of one clip if you’re shooting ultra-high res and downscaling it. The BIGGEST caution to this exciting exercise is to not go overboard. Try to avoid scaling up beyond 110% – especially if your camera isn’t all that… great. There’s nothing worse and noticeable than pixelated footage add to that, re-positioned clips that don’t work if the subject or person looks out of place. The last thing to try in your edit is color grading or correcting your footage. No no NO!!! Introducing the J-Cut and L-Cut If you’re in the video editing business or simply like to edit videos then you really need to know about the J-cut and L-cut (if you don’t already). These are a vital technique duo that all editors use to allow audiences to see the context of the dialogue rather than just the dialogue itself. What makes an L-cut or J-cut work, is the combination of dialogue and imagery. For an L-cut, the dialogue continues as the camera cuts to another image. On the other hand, a J-cut is when the dialogue plays while we see contextual images but then cuts to the source of the dialogue. Source Choose Close-ups and Medium Shots over Wide Shots For any kind of video, it’s important to cut between different camera angles…right? This is done to allow the audience to better understand the space where the event or action took place. As soon as the vocals begin, or dialogue is contextualized, close-ups and medium shots hold the most meaning for the audience. Not only is this action, engaging, to watch what the person is saying or what message is being shared, it also draws in the facial expressions of the person speaking as well as the body language that all contribute to the overall understanding of the story. Before Tuning Out… By now you’ve gathered quite a range of tips and techniques. Some you may be familiar with while others, not so much. Still, the take away from all of this is to always go for an organization before starting any video edit. Go through all footage and understanding the style, type, and story of the video before starting to work on any edits. Have your work folders easily available from where you will use sound bits, effects, graphics, etc. Make sure your drives are speedy and efficient. Never overlook details, in lighting, color, close-ups and medium shots, etc. Don’t be afraid to re-frame if you can stabilize or even cover up if that works to the benefits of a well edited video. Above all, make the most of using short-cuts on the keyboard so you save time and are able to add a bigger dose of creativity instead.

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

questions I've been getting on our channel about drywall and repairs and home maintenance and I have a simple message to tell you don't worry about it it's just drywall so in today's video I'm gonna show you all the tips and tricks that learn from my past years of working on the construction site now to fix messes like this messes like this gaps and cracks unevenness holes oil paint transition when you put your drywall in backwards how to cover up stucco ceilings and different kinds of scenarios where you've got texture on the roof there is a lot of information out there that can be really simply applied to solve your problems but if you're intimidated with touching your drywall that you're gonna be too creative and do something risky for instance if you want to know if you have a leaking plumbing valve don't be afraid to open a huge hole in the back of the closet take a look it's so easy to replace and repair drywall we're gonna show you all the steps today to take the fear out of been opening up your walls and solving your problems number one if you have a hole and you've got to repair it the easiest way to do it without damaging your house cutting your electrical circuits cutting a hole in your plumbing take your often knife okay you can get on Amazon just follow our link in the description you set it to just a little bit more than 1/2 inch okay and you want to cut the hole wider than the damage because impact damage always is bigger on the back side of the drywall than the front it's kind of like a hollow-point bullet it doesn't look too bad up front but it's not designed to make a big mess on the front right here we go all right and you want to just run a couple of passes until you're all the way through piece of cake because once you've got a square hole it's easy to patch it now if you've seen some of our other videos you've probably seen this already but this is such a great technique it's worth revisiting this is called the California patch and what I'm doing is I'm just eyeballing to cut a piece of drywall a couple inches wider in both directions so that'll cover my hole okay what I'm gonna do line it up take my knife just inside the cut and I'm gonna score the brown paper from the backside it's both sides and we're gonna do the same here and we're gonna try to give ourselves a little bit of room to work with cuz you only want to do this once it's okay if it's a little smaller than the hole break it and then hold them and then peel it from the paper leaving the paper on the front this makes the perfect patch one of the most amazing benefits is at the white paper on the front of the drywall is thinner than the drywall tape that you would buyer to patch it with so it actually creates a lot less work when you go to finish you're gonna take your drywall compound and you can buy this in a variety of different ways if you're a homeowner you're just doing one repair you can get in a little tub if you're gonna buy just a little bit I would recommend buying the powder by the 45 or the 90 mix up for yourself because then you'll always have it on hand you get real good value it's only ten bucks for a huge bag and the other stuff that you buy in the little tubs generally is really difficult to sand it's gonna drive you crazy now you take a little bit of mud and the idea here is to leave it on the inside of that framing that of the cut okay doesn't work too well in the top ever but here we go here we go alright and then all the way around take it and we're gonna put a little bit on the inside edges of all the rope as well and we're just gonna press it in if you find it not going in all the way maybe there's a little bit of restriction just use your knife to level off the corners and then press the tape in you're just embedding the drywall tape and you want to do this just once okay if you work it too much it's gonna wrinkle because of the moisture and it'll cause you all kinds of pain so get it in wipe off the extra mud and walk away after that's dry you can come back and do another coat and it should be done with a four by ten knife like this alright and I know it's not dry yet so bear with me okay and use outward pressure on the top pull it nice and tight and then come through the middle at the end all right if you let it dry between coats sometimes a second application with this knife is all you're gonna need so you don't have to do it over and over and over again you don't have to sand it between coats just let it set up less is more pull it tight and flat and you'll be happy every single time the second situation I see a lot of people commenting about is they need to check their and do an inspection on their valve or they want to change the valve from the backside if you want to do an inspection anywhere in your house let's say there's sharkbite valves and maybe you think might be dripping or something like that you can buy one of these spring-loaded trap door okay they work great and the idea is the hole that you have on the wall needs to be as big as this framework here plus some distance for this to tie in and put some compression on so what I generally try to do this isn't 8x8 but I'll try to cut the hole so that it's about that big nice and square so here we go not I'm not big enough here and you can use a drywall saw for this and you can cut the hole bigger than you need okay [Music] it only cost six bucks and all we do to set this in is put pressure on the single tab first because it will slide and you push it over and you rest this in and it's snaps back in place now if this is down on the wall by the toilet or if this is in the ceiling of your basement or if this is in the closet on the back wall nobody cares you can put these in all day long you can even paint them the same color as the wall or the ceiling it's very standard you can also use the same trapdoor in the ceiling in the basement for shutoff valves and pipes in different situations or clean outs for your sink island whatever have you so don't be intimidated if you need to have access to the area behind drywall cut a hole stick in a cover because it's that easy to take off and it looks just pretty good the next the next trick I'm going to show you is actually it answers a few different questions what do I do to fill big gaps what about if I'm going from a new wall to an old wall and there's lots of damage or it's lath and plaster and there's lots of damage okay or if the old wall is a different thickness these situations are all taken care of if you own one of these guns having a foam gun gives you lots of control I'm going to just get this started here here we go turn the trigger really low and you can feel just about any gap or crack exactly the amount of foam that you're going to need now if it's really nasty you can overfill it it doesn't matter because what this does this sets up in about 15 or 20 minutes okay and you might find that this is a great alternative to using 45-minute drywall compound all right if you already have this tool it's really handy it does a great job and it becomes the backing remember we're just adding mud and the surface this becomes the backing it also is an adhesive between the different material so you don't get cracks you don't need to apply any paper that's amazing so one of the questions I get is a lot of people their first time renovators they've done all the installation they're down to their last piece of drywall it's not quite big enough to fit or you've got a big gap in the ceiling because you're in an old house like mine and the ceiling has a bit of a ball to it and you can't install everything square and level so again take about the foam open it up pretty healthy shoot it at the corner so it has something to hit and it'll expand in and out of that corner and don't worry about how much of a mess it makes remember the goal here is that when that's done drying its expanded in behind got solid so you can trim off the face and have a backing to do your taping now we're gonna go up to the top of the ceiling where I did this yesterday and I'll show you how it looks so the secret here is we're trading backing right so open up your blade so I this tough to boat where do you think the depth is all right and we've been sawing action and then just gently trim it across there okay and then you can clean it up nice and tight all right now I'm only gonna demonstrate just a little bit less I'll go right into the corners I actually do need this to be finished today okay I'm happy with that it's not looks pretty nasty but it's ready to be worked with so I'm just gonna tape out the joint here a little bit real quick now when you've got a scenario like this I've actually got about an inch gap from where the drywall finished till the ceiling and the ceiling doesn't make it all the way into the corner it's a nasty mess and I made it a nasty mess on purpose to show you how easy it is to fix there we go run your mud off the side of this knife here no this foam does not react to the compound this isn't gonna melt it or affect it at all okay yeah got to keep the dirt out of your mud yeah I'm just gonna go what I call flat taping flat taping flat taping is the process of just going on one surface I'm not going around the corner and you can push that up as nice tight as you want okay and then we'll press it in now that we've got that pressed in you don't have to wait till tomorrow to come back to fix it here's one other trick when you're taping with much you can do multiple layers of mud and paper it's okay you can sandwich it as long as you give it time to dry before you come back the next time to fiddle around with it okay try to keep your mud in the middle of your hock the whole time you're working all right now we're gonna apply them under the ceiling catch your drips try to work as clean as possible okay there we go and then again off the side of the knife we're gonna snowplow it right in there okay just pretend that that paper and bud there it wasn't a tear of previously and I measure off a piece of tape gonna get a nice straight edge pre fold it there we go we have a nice flat surface up top so I'm gonna use that to trust my line gentle pressure all the way across okay painting the edge one more pass that's good now hold the knife flat against the wall cuz if you are ain't too loosey-goosey with it you'll just push everything in and make a mess there we go IMAX zoom in there and tell me if that corner doesn't look perfect now if you want to save even more time and you're comfortable with using your knife you can go back over top and you can apply the inside corner of the forage application right over that paper tape alright and then the next time you come back all you'll need to do is a six inch knife just to make sure that it's perfectly smooth and feathered oh all right done it's not that tricky anybody can do this the next issue you're gonna run into is I get questions like this all the time hey I got a rusty nail or a rusty staple or residue from tape or oops I was doing a weird angle and I installed the drywall backwards and I see the brown paper can i tape over that and the answer is yes of course but you have to prep it first you need to use a Primus so here we go I've got tape let's get this out of here okay well the tapes gone but I still got that red stuff left got broke a poor showing I've got dark pencil I don't care even if it's marker there is one solution for all your problems and if you're taping your house you've got to have this can on you at all times pom pom yeah if you're a fan of the channel you've seen me use it before I put this on everything okay brown paper no problem oil-based primer red tape no problem oil-based primer marker no problem oil-based primer with the pigment look at that this just disappearing I'm doing an infomercial here oil-based primer works on everything let's say you have an old house with laughs and plaster and oil paint kills you can buy it in a can and roll it on the wall they even have an odorless formula of an oil primer just for transitioning from oil to latex so that you don't have your paint peeling off over time if you're ever stuck and you were in trouble and you don't know how to solve a problem think oil-based primer and then all of your new muds and compounds will bond to it if you use oil-based primer over plaster new drywall compound will bond to that so you don't have to go to the buy plaster and mix it up yourself saves a lot of time and money this is money in the bank and before anybody starts putting it in the comment section no kills did not sponsor this video I just love the stuff okay let's move on I don't need the tape here anymore now we're gonna get away from the traditional drywall compound we're gonna get into the quick-set mud we're gonna show you everything that it can do here's another one of the most popular questions out there I can't find sheetrock for five anywhere what do I get this is a CGC company that means Canadian gypsum corporation trade from the United States you're gonna find a u.s. G which is United States gypsum okay they make a forty five mix as well this is not proprietary technology all right it's really basic stuff so 45 here is 45 there it's the same stuff just a different supplier we have border issues right so okay I'll just get along all right then what we're gonna do with the powder of course and a lot of you might have seen this alright so we're gonna just do a quick short version of this we're gonna make a lot of volcano on the hawk and I don't know sometimes it's easier to move the hawk than the knife all right volcano time here we go the higher the walls the easier it is to control everything okay now I'm using hot water if you want your coat 45 minute mud to set super fast so you can keep on working use hot water throw a little salt in it right this is a chemical reaction we're dealing with now so basic science grade eight heat plus salt changes all the chemical reactions and speeds things up so we're gonna go add my hot water Oh making a mess this is not the way the demonstrations supposed to work better close that up got a dam up the hole alright got it to do to do I'm gonna sprinkle it in of course and try not to have another dam break on us but it happens here we go doesn't have to go over the top sometimes it start leaking from underneath if you want to you can go with a little bit less water until you know you've got it under control but I found with this hot water and you've really just got to be able to move and manage the mess and it's worth paying for here we go ready now we're gonna go for it we're gonna go making a mess that's okay construction site yeah that's okay we're not gonna worry about it because this reaction happens so fast that if I don't move and get it done by the time I'm done fiddling around it'll ought to be red rock hard try to mix it somewhat smooth this is a race against time here we go and it's already turning into a hard pace now just for fun we're gonna come back after this brief brief word from our sponsors we don't have a sponsor or am I talking about I'm just saying it's not yet yeah I know it's gonna happen that quick give it about 60 seconds okay so now we're back we have only been a couple minutes and to be honest it's not completely hard but it is setup okay it's stiff enough that I can work with and I'm just gonna cover this now with my regular compound and it won't end up blending together and peeling out of the hole and when this is dry it's not gonna shrink or expand or do anything crazy like that on you you can do all this at the same time all right I mean is this mud my goodness it's a little loosey-goosey what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna put paper tape majority on the old wall all right and I'm pressing it on the original hard surface and now I'm just gonna set it into the soft with a little bit of pressure and then I'll watch the mud just rising away from the tape and that's how I know that I've embedded it I don't have a ridge from the mud I haven't embedded it and it will bubble there we go you remember earlier we talked about that we can use expansion foam and it bridges the gap and it seals it together so you don't need the paper tape you should use the tape anyway if you're using the 45 you have to use the tape all right again we're just gonna come down and set this up with a nice new layer mud and we're gonna embed it on the surface here now nice force here on the original drywall okay and what we're trying to do is eliminate the action of having too much blood stuck in behind the basement we don't want to raise the surface off too much now we're going to just press those two pieces of paper together that are floating over that mud in the middle okay look at that it used to be a nasty mess is now really well embedded together and if you see any areas where the paper tape looks like it's coming apart just get your knife in there put a little mud follow it up make sure the surface is nice and wet so that it doesn't bubble so okay while you're working you can always use the pail as a table okay so we're getting close to the end of all of the questions I've still got one two I got three more things to show you but before I do my floor is creaky I've got to screw that down oh yeah let me just address this one issue if you have dents remember drywall is just dust compressed between papers so if you have a dent if it's dented on the surface it's also dented on the backside it doesn't get compressed it gets moved and that's fine because dents can be adjusted simply like that you don't even think twice about them just fill them and go unless they're big enough that they've actually broken through the backside my rule is this if it's not bigger than one and a half inches it's not concerned about all right you don't need tape you don't have to fuss with it just fill it and you'll be fine now getting back to this all right once this is filled you got to treat this like a butt joint you want to fill this side and then you want to fill this side okay and by Phil meaning pressure on the outside here and pressure on the outside here I think it'd take a little bit of mud and run it right down the middle with a fair amount of pressure and here's a secret will be even it be don't touch it again let that's right completely what we've done now is we've set the depth of the wall to this point this Ridge simply means that I have to fill a little bit here and a little bit here to get this nice and smooth this Ridge actually becomes your guide line now tomorrow when it's dry I can come back and I can use my four inch knife just scrape off that Ridge all right and I'll start in the middle with a thin coat and I'll be using pressure going the outside if you want to know how to actually finish a butt joint properly you can click the link to this video here we've done some information on this series previously and it'll go through all of you how to fill corners and do it all that sort of thing when to use the 45 minute mud versus the other it's a great video I think you're gonna like it and one other thing I'm not going to cover today is nail pops we've got a great video on nail pops we call them nail pops if it's a nail or a screw so don't get offended if you have one or the other it's all the same business and it's all dealt with in the same manner if it's a nail hammered in a little bit if it's a screw you screw it in a little bit but follow all that information in the card up in the corner okay yeah let's get on to the next two things that are going to be life savers on your job site so the next thing that people get intimidated about dealing with drywall is the mess and rightly so because drywall dust is actually lighter than air it seems right it goes everywhere there are two things you can do to manage your mess well actually three one you can clean as you go resist the temptation to sweep unless you but this this is what we call drywall sweeping compound all right and there are a couple of different companies that make this stuff one of them makes it green one of them makes it red I buy this stuff because it's available on my local Home Depot and the truth is I've been shopping Home Depot forever because Raya grew up we didn't have options it was Home Depot or no Depot so I'm just really used to their store and products what you do is you just sprinkle it just like as if you're raking your grass right you throw it up against the wall and this step is formulated it instantly bonds with that light drywall compound okay and it will bond to it and then you can sweep so it doesn't go up in the air all right if I sweep compound regular you see all the dust floating around did you see it if I sweep it with the red dust you're not kicking anything up in the air all right that whole bag will last the entire job so 15 20 bucks whatever it is to not be kicking that dust up brilliant invention the other thing you can do is you're gonna open your window and you can shove a fan in it okay the best defense you have against dust in your house - putting a fan in your window like this you can get these at home table for 40 bucks and they blow a ton of air that's what I do without a doubt the most intimidating project in everybody's house is the stucco ceilings everybody's worried about and we get comments every day how do I deal with my stipple ceiling what if I have asbestos should I remove it should I take it down should I go over top should I skim coat it dear Lord no skim coating that ceiling will take you more time to energy and money than doing this take your piece of drywall get yourself a lift or a couple friends okay throw some mud on it and the thicker the texture the more mud you're gonna want to have I'm just doing a quick demonstration so I think for purpose of demonstration I'm gonna cut this down to size you're gonna want to use these to install these are called drywall laminating screws and it's just like it sounds it's for sticking one sheet of drywall into another sheet of drywall when you have no idea where the framework is here's our worse you take your sheet with your compound okay you stick it under your ceiling yeah that easy and you throw these in all right now these screws will not tighten up and be pretty okay what they will do is they'll hold that sheet in place until the drywall compound dries then the next day you come back you guess it um removed the screws tape your joints fill your little holes you can put in one of these screws every couple of feet it's not necessary to put a ton of them in just make sure you're holding it in place till it's dry and you can put a brand new ceiling over top of any textured ceiling in just a couple of hours no mess no worry about asbestos mwah perfect every time and if you want to know how good that drywall mud holds trust me when I say it's not going anywhere it creates like a vacuum so here is my secret for what to do with my mud at the end of the day you've already mixed it in a pail clean down the sides okay and if you like you can even use a sponge the closer you get to the bottom the more you're going to want to have a sponge clean all the mud off okay you know nothing's perfect in this world this mud has been exposed to the air the whole time you're working and drying it you're going to put your hock on top of it as a lid and it's going to dry out a little bit more so what you do just put a layer of water on there here's your lid there's your tools okay and you're good to go the next day now the next day when you get here you don't have crusty dry mud on the pail so when you're taking your compound on you're not gonna have those hard chunks in the mud which will wreck your finish this is how you protect it so it's silky smooth all the time soapy smooth like Zohan now one of the questions we get all the time is should I buy the small tubs no I always buy it buy a big box or big pail it's not a lot of money and if you don't use it all it'll only last three or four weeks after you've opened it up and started using it okay it's not a big deal you can make your own compound and put it in a pail and store it like this in the last three weeks bottom line is you want to make sure that your mud is in perfect condition for doing the job now listen guys we've got other great drywall videos that help you with a

Alejandra Acuña, Agronomy Coordinator de UC Davis Chile. 0 comments muy buenas tardes soy francisco díaz el gerente de socios y de comunicaciones del centro de la universidad de california en davis aquí en chile es un gusto para mí saludarlos y en nombre de la universidad de california del centro del país darle la más cordial bienvenida a todas y todos los que nos acompañan en este webinar donde queremos abordar temas relacionados con el uso y la eficiencia del agua en los sistemas de riego pero también su administración en las cuencas hidrográficas de nuestro país concretamente la temática es la información y la modelación encuadran en cuencas hidrográficas experiencias en california y el caso de el aconcagua en nuestro país moderador de esta actividad va a ser el gerente general de el centro de la universidad de california en chile el doctor mauricio ocaño les los dejó a todos con el que irá presentando a quienes intervienen y también moderará los espacios de pregunta interacción antes de dar la palabra definitivamente a mauricio algunas indicaciones prácticas para poder formular consultas a los expositores ustedes se encuentran en su botonera abajo una sección donde se enseñaran preguntas y respuestas o bien you and i la solamente las letras que hablan de questions and cancer solo en ese espacio se pueden formular las preguntas no está habilitado el chat para interactuar esperamos tener entonces una buena conversación técnica que sea de provecho para todos ustedes muy buenas tardes mauricio caníbales por favor hola buenas tardes bienvenidos a todos es un placer nuevamente poder reunirnos antes en torno al tema al tema del agua y especialmente después de llevar más de más de un año y medio dos años trabajando puntualmente dentro de la cuenca del aconcagua está esta actividad se enmarca entre otras cosas en el proyecto en el proyecto que llevamos desarrollando en la cuenca con la dirección general de agua con él con las juntas de vigilancia y otros actores de la proyección con el apoyo con el apoyo y con que hay que decirlo otras maneras sobre el apoyo desde el punto de vista financiero sino que el apoyo a plaquetas este tipo de iniciativas realmente puedan pueden funcionar desde la corso particularmente la corfo de la dirección regional de valparaíso dentro del marco de este webinar así como otros que hemos estado realizando nuestra idea es poder mostrar a los distintos usuarios al público chileno como california que tiene condiciones muy similares ha estado lidiando con esto y transmitir esa experiencia hacia asia los actores locales me refiero chileno solamente las cuencas esto los movimientos a través de la presentación y bueno para partir este evento es abierto por el director nacional de la dirección acciones de amor aleja del ministerio obras públicas señaló que christie's quien sea dirigir a todos nosotros después de buscar hablará el director regional de corfo de la región de valparaíso acuña así que dejo a ellos la palabra parte de oscar y mauricio hola no tengo acceso al vídeo así que no sé si no que me quieren ver con acceso no sé cómo lo solucionamos no dice no puede iniciar su vídeo por quiero perder ahora lo detuvo vamos a ver en la parte técnica carolina tú puedes ver eso inicial me parece que es gracia [Risas] buenas tardes bueno muchas gracias por la invitación por organizar este seminario que no que es muy importante porque por lo que voy a explicar ahora para todos evidentes que chile es un país que como tantos otros está enfrentando una sequía que ya denominamos como sequía estructural y nuestras proyecciones para el futuro muestran un deterioro mayor en la disponibilidad de agua y para hacer frente a este desafío estamos convencidos que tengan la gestión del recurso e indispensable y para gestionar lo sabemos todo muy bien se necesita más información y más planificación de la que actualmente tenemos se dice con mucha propiedad que lo que no se mide no se gestiona ni se planifica y por tanto el levantar información a nivel de las cuencas el levantar información de las fuentes naturales de agua en cada de las cuencas indispensables para después avanzar un proceso de planificación y este llamado los desafíos que nos hemos propuesto como dirección general de agua para este periodo 2018 2021 está entre los siete desafíos principales el poder aportar también de información y de planificación y en esa línea hemos ido dando algunos avances importantes ustedes conocerán por ejemplo que la dga ha actualizado el balance internacional que eran muy antiguos está prácticamente completo y nos falta una parte de la zona austral continental y la isla de pascua pero resto el país ya está completo ese balance hemos terminado también la dga un estudio demanda actual y proyectada esto esto es incluso anterior a mi propia gestión porque ambos son proyectos que se comenzaron a iniciar en la gestión pasada y nosotros nos ha tocado tomar la posta lo cual habla de que incluso aún cuando los buenos cambien todos coincidimos en la importancia de generar una mejor información respecto al recurso hídrico también hemos dado un paso muy importante a partir del año pasado en términos de medición de tracción es efectiva a lo largo del país hemos comenzado un plan muy ambicioso con el monitoreo de pozos para la extracción de agua subterránea esto ya se inició llevamos más de 132 sistemas de aprovechamiento hidrológico en los cuales este proceso ya se ha iniciado eso incluye la casi totalidad de las 79 áreas donde hay prohibición para entregar importante donde mayor y de mayor importancia la medición y en los próximos meses vamos a empezar o vamos a comenzar con la medición en todas las bocatomas del país esto sin duda que es un cambio muy importante es un acceso a una información muy relevante que hoy no tenemos y en materia de planificación y modelación hemos también iniciado ya a partir de allí basado un trabajo muy ordenado y muy planificado justamente para poder mejorar la información y la planificación el asiento 1 cuenca del país y comenzamos con las 20 cuencas donde hay más estrés hídrico y dentro de los meses de este año y comienzo el próximo año llevamos contar con los 20 primeros planes de gestión estratégica para las 20 cuencas más extensa del país y después vamos a ir avanzando hasta poder completar el acento en cuenca del país en un plazo probablemente de 8 o 10 años en este contexto sin duda que el trabajo que está abordando la universidad de davis es muy relevante con su proyecto central de información y modelación ideológica que se desarrolla en la cuenca del aconcagua un trabajo que hemos hecho en conjunto tanto el equipo de jucilei dish como el equipo de la elegida y la junta de vigilancia del río aconcagua y aquí destacar la importancia que le asignamos a este tipo de trabajo popular colaborativo donde distintas inclusiones ponen a disposición de los usuarios el conocimiento para poder concluir con un plan una modelación que sea relevante para la toma de decisiones los planes que como decía hemos iniciado y también en esa línea de proyectos y davis no son un planes para la academia no son estudios para la academia principalmente sino que está más bien orientado hacia la gestión de red a la toma de decisiones en la toma de decisiones que puede hacer la institución el estado que tiene que invertir en infraestructura hídrica por ejemplo pero también muy importante en los mismos usuarios que tienen que tomar decisiones respecto a inversiones privadas que tengan que hacer y que dependan del agua para ellos también es muy importante por eso que es una de nuestras aspiraciones que todo estos planes que estamos haciendo en la ciudad estén disponibles para los distintos usuarios a través de una plataforma a la cual se puede acceder es de internet básicamente una plataforma online donde esté disponible la información que se generan en estos modelos y esté disponible ciertos tipos de modelación es para que los usuarios puedan ir haciendo si estas simulaciones respecto a las materias que más le interesa y hay que este proyecto de lucidez tenga no sólo el valor de avanzar en la planificación sino también el valor de poner a disposición de los usuarios esta moderación que en la base de esta planificación de la cuenca y esto que estamos comenzando ahora con usb en nuestra aspiración a hacerlo para la totalidad de los planes que se generen en la dga de ahí entonces que sea no sólo extraordinariamente importante el trabajo y si davis que sea también muy importante y relevante poder conocer la experiencia y poder discutirlas en este web seminal así que los felicito le dará escuela posibilidad al mes dejado dar estas palabras iniciales y les deseo el máximo éxito lo que viene en este webinar gracias muchas gracias aunque seguimos con fernando acuña director regional d de la corfo reacción de valparaíso gracia mauricio un saludo a ustedes gracias por llevar adelante esto independiente del momento que estamos viviendo igual seguir con estos proyectos e igual seguir dándole nos parece importante como corfo salud oscar buscar gracias por la participación y por el compromiso de la dga da en este importante proyecto y también bueno a los actores es cierto que son los a los dirigentes que están presentes de las tres secciones de tres de las cuatro secciones del vídeo con caguas y que un gran saludo y un saludo a los 100 llegamos a 100 a los 100 conectados hoy día y estamos demostrando que y por eso le decía felicitaciones porque no obstante lo que está sucediendo y todo lo complicado que estamos igual seguir adelante con estos importantes proyectos recordarle que si usted ve la riva mi cabeza siempre está proyecto corfo este es un proyecto que fue un bien público bueno nosotros como corfo siempre estábamos preocupados de que los bienes públicos tan orientados a levantar un cierto un dolor y poder solucionar un tema es un tema de coordinación como tenemos otros programas estratégicos y los bienes públicos también de corfo este como bien público la idea es poder aportar y así que feliz de que se esté llevando adelante está con los financiamientos de la corfo yo creo que lo importante que son el tema del recurso hídrico el otro día tuve en el lanzamiento del pp y de petorca y recordaba mi experiencia en argumentos con los años que viene y como en la gestión del poco recurso hídrico que tenía y allá en la zona una épica les permitió ir avanzando y tomándose el desierto solamente por la gestión hídrica y ahora son plantaciones grandes de cítricos y de otros de de aceituna y otras cosas que ya en el cerca pica en el desierto entonces aquí hay un tema que siempre hablamos el tema del recurso hídrico yo creo que aquí tenemos a paulo que me ha explicado parte de este proyecto es el tomar los días que el ejecutivo de corfo que a mí me parece súper interesante de memoria común como ingeniero electrónico y como magíster en gestión en la mezcla de las dos cosas la tecnología cierto con el tema de gestión entonces usando tecnología para la gestión hídrica yo creo que es un recurso escaso sabemos que no sabe mejor que yo así que hacer gestión de esto es súper importante yo creo que vamos a conocerlo avance en esta plataforma lo avance con agua y también conocer si esto el caso de california yo creo que es muy importante que nos vamos documentando y vamos viendo como avanzando que nos interesan como corfo que estos proyectos que se financian cierto también vayan avanzando y vayan pasando como un trabajo conjunto cierto como también se llama mauricio conocí a oscar este es un trabajo de todo ciento un trabajo de coordinación y que en conjunto sacamos adelante así que feliz feliz de estar y de tener esta convocatoria de tener este interés estamos empeñados y ha visto los avances y que parece muy interesante cómo han ido avanzando y esto también es importante un mensaje la idea es que un objetivo de estos proyectos es también darle la sustentabilidad o sea hay un trabajo yo sé que usted está trabajando en eso de como usted de que esto se proyecte en el tiempo y que esta coordinación se transforme en algo que sea permanente en el tiempo así que eso nos interesa también de sobremanera bar que esta coordinación siga hacia adelante así que felicitaciones por esta actividad algo digo con estos 102 conectados y que seguimos adelante con estas actividades ahora vamos a echar de menos café cierto lo que me disguste pero pero estamos saliendo adelante ya y sobre todo el contacto la gente pero importante verlo velado bien y que no obstante esto como digo insisto se sigue adelante nuestros proyectos nos interesa que tengan éxito como corfo y no perder de vista siempre estar atento a eso de la proyección y la sustentabilidad así que un abrazo a todos muchas gracias por la invitación gracias gracias por tu palabra es muy cierto lo que dice de hecho el botón incidencia siento estamos de las cosas que el cob y nos ha obligado a hacer conectarnos cada vez más en forma electrónica cosas que antes teníamos que tener café teníamos que tener las galletas pero eso también nos limitaba el acceso el acceso a tener panelistas a cuadrar agendas de panelistas que no están necesariamente en chile y además de poder ampliar esta convocatoria no solamente a la zona del proyecto es por eso que nosotros en esta actividad la siguiente se organizó inicialmente pensando en los involucrados del proyecto planteamos a todos chiles de hecho hay muchos conectados de otras puntas de vigilancia de otras asociaciones u otros usuarios de agua a lo largo a lo largo de chile y es también nos permite tener varios seminarios distintas temáticas puestas a punto de hecho las 12 del día venía saliendo tenía muchos seminarios de agua pero en temas en temas de calidad de agua los lagos con los lava por unos patagónicos con la experiencia en ley tajos ley tajo center que está también alojado en yushu davis con algunas iniciativas que tenemos acá en chile en la región de la región de los lagos la región de los ríos y más al sur con los lagos patagónicos bueno ahora dejo con ustedes la presentación del doctor es de samuel sandoval tan sano como lo llevamos siempre sabe especialista en recursos hídricos de 10 y davis es de responsable de programas de investigación en gestión de agua dentro la universidad era desarrollado con otros métodos para mejorar la gestión del agua en el uso humano en el uso en el uso de la agricultura zuma no solamente la potable además siempre poniendo en la balanza cómo se hace a nivel internacional los temas ambientales sanz ha realizado su investigación principalmente en el estado de california y en las cuencas transfronterizas del río grano recientemente ha evaluado la cantidad de agua que se puede ahorrar para disminuir la demanda de agua en la instrucción de agua salina en la costa central de california donde hay un tema del agua que está por la vida y recientemente ha trabajado un estudio para determinar caudales ecológicos en todo el estado de california también ha publicado un estudio sobre el cambio temporal y espacial de eficiencia en los sistemas de riego en el estado de california entre otras cosas porque con un examen espeso y una gran ventaja que si bien él está en california pero desde orígenes latinos replicable español ya está hablando chileno últimamente sí que se está logrando muy fuerte también dentro de este proyecto no solamente su experiencia casi involucrado directamente el frito gracias antes que nada bienvenidos a todos y lo que voy a hacer es que [Música] ahora puede compartir la pantalla y antes de empezar con todo esto algo que me gustaría mencionarles ustedes están viendo esta pantalla en la parte de abajo debe de salir una una barra de herramientas y en esa barrera de herramientas debe de venir algo que dice van eyck y ya entonces con esto sin sale pamela en la parte de abajo debe de venir las herramientas debe de venir una que diga así como juanes en respuesta a preguntas y respuestas entonces aquí por favor que es como si hubieran 22 chats en ese si tienen alguna pregunta ayman del lado y sé que yo voy a ir filtrando las preguntas o al final o si son más un poco más sencillas pues lo haré en el momento es lo primero entonces también lo que dice morís y es súper importante antes me parece que la distancia estaba de un panelista a un auditorio ahora realmente la distancia está de tu monitora a mi monitor estamos pues platicando no los dos eso es importante la tercera es que este trabajo que les voy a prevé presentar ha sido también en colaboración con el canal y con esta alejandra cugno con javier con roberto se ha armado muy buen equipo y con el conocida ibis chile y bueno pues la idea es seguir compartiendo un poco más de información por ejemplo maría como pareció que el leer que este seminario va a quedar disponible en una url y es correcto y también ya les enviamos las copias de la presentación entonces este sí decirles vamos a enviar tanto el vídeo como la presentación bueno vamos a ir avanzando un poquito aquí ok primero les voy a presentar un poco acerca de cuáles son las expectativas de este seminario y vamos a hablar de gestión del agua un poco de gobernanza modelos y luego ya nos vamos en el caso de estudio y hablaré más acerca del river después salí a hablar acerca del río aconcagua y algunas recomendaciones lo que ustedes ven aquí son gestos de trabajo es texto están viendo aquí este es el río bravo esta será del russian river y este es del estado de california y si se dan cuenta o sea independientemente de cómo como sucede esto pues se ven igual no siempre es la gente alrededor de una mesa hablando acerca de problemas relacionados al agua y miren en este momento no me mire tanto a legislar bueno en el caso del il rivers y hablar un poco de legislaciones pero voy a tratar de mantenerla en un contexto general para que así podamos hacer un poco más de correlación o relación entre en california al estar un poco acerca de gestión del agua y gestión del agua no solamente se refiere a la parte de herramientas que esto es algo de lo que estamos hablando ahorita o en la parte de instrumentos económicos son medidas técnicas no vamos a poner un poco más del concreto o hacer la parte más de infraestructura pero también es acerca de cómo se dan las tomas de decisiones el contexto físico y ambiental y el son no solamente manejar el agua sino los recursos que dependen de ella y bueno pues tratar de relacionar algunos proyectos de california in chile así en alguna discusión percibo que hay uno que les quiere decir es que nos vamos a ir a un nivel un poquito más más general este es el mapa esta es la guía de los temas que iré tocando y ya conforme los vaya tocando bueno pues iremos a ir viendo cómo cómo se va desarrollando la presentación primero les hablaré acerca de gestión del agua básicamente hacemos la gestión del agua porque el agua no la tenemos en la cantidad y calidad adecuada en el momento en el que la necesitamos y entonces existe esta disciplina que se llama y ese manejo del agua o gestión del agua en la cual utilizamos métodos o técnicas para re distribuir el agua en tiempo y espacio incluyendo el medio ambiente y con esta inversión visión de sustentabilidad que es para hoy en el futuro esto que ustedes ven aquí el mapa que ven ustedes aquí básicamente en en estas áreas azul azul marino y azul claro el que el 90% de la precipitación en california y solamente acá y el 10% en la además este 90% de precipitación que hay en el 40 por ciento del área entonces aquí el problema que tenemos es que bueno primero solamente llueve en invierno o básicamente en invierno y se necesita y básicamente en esta en esta zona en esta parte norte las demandas pues si uno utiliza el agua en todo el a lo largo de todo el año y para la agricultura pues se utiliza más en la época del verano y las demandas agrícolas son básicamente aquí en el valle central en el valle de imperial en el valle de salinas pájaro y toda la santa santamaría santa margarita bueno eso es cómo se utiliza entonces tenemos una desconexión en tiempo es decir 9 en una época y necesitamos el agua en otra época del año entonces pues para eso lo que hemos generado son este tipo de almacenamientos todos los triangulitos que ustedes ven aquí es una serie de almacenamiento tienen distintos colores porque son operados o son manejados por distintas instituciones federal estatal y local entonces cómo movemos el agua en tiempo mediante presas y acuíferos así es como almacenamos el agua y después pues vendría la parte espacial que que hay en ciertos lugares y las necesitamos en otros lugares y para eso bueno se han desarrollado acueductos canales tuberías no en este caso es aquí la parte más importante es que se hace mucho trasvase de agua se mueve mucha agua de un de una parte a otra es decir del río sacramento se puede mover hasta la la otra esquina del estado y así no en él aunque en teoría bueno pues esto se ve muy muy bien yo les puedo decir que no ha dado muy buen resultado de estas políticas desde los 1920 1940 y después ha sido más que hacer un tema no en una gestión de demanda de agua ha sido una gestión de abastecimiento de agua ya qué me refiero que si me falta un problema no es que vaya a crecer y que necesita más agua el problema es donde me van a traer el agua la relación de esto es que si ustedes tienen algún familiar o alguna familia alguna persona que algún amigo que lleva dinero entonces la solución o lo que aquí ustedes están viendo se incrementarle el monto del adeudo no más que enseñarle a esta persona a vivir con con sus propios recursos financieros es exactamente lo mismo aquí más que cada cuenca haya intentado vivir con sus recursos pues le ido a pedir prestado a los a los vecinos y esto esto ha generado que les digo desde esta época desde 1920 pues hasta la fecha la gente siga sobreexplotando todos estos proyectos que ustedes vieron aquí fueron generados porque existía una una sobreexplotación de agua en esta zona del acuífero entonces primero se les trajo agua superficial se les ha traído más agua superficial a los agricultores y cómo se dan cuenta aquí el suelo antes estaba en 1925 a esta altura esto será en 1955 1977 y ahorita está eso más hundido porque segundo porque han sobreexplotado acuífero de abajo se a pesar de que se le traiga agua la gente sigue sobre explotando la cosa no ha sido la solución los trasvases iniciar algo me queda súper claro es que cuando alguien debe la la estrategia no es e incrementar la línea de crédito la estrategia es ver cómo puede vivir con sus propios recursos financieros y esto es lo mismo en agua extraer más agua es ver cómo se puede ajustar un nuevo con los recursos que no tienen bueno esto es por ejemplo todavía seguimos con sobreexplotación en algunas de estas zonas el suelo se sigue esté asentando alrededor de sencillos viendo alrededor de uno diez quince centímetros al año es increíble y bueno pues ha pasado más que los descensos de la de la napa es que cuando se saca el agua del subsuelo el suelo se va contrayendo en las capas de arcilla se van contrayendo y por eso se hunde el suelo entonces es una lana para ahorita ya debe de estar allí alrededor de los 400 a 600 metros de profundidad cuando antes estaba el nivel del suelo ambiente relación con el río esta sería una clasificación de donde tenemos la alteración básicamente la alteración ha llegado a todas las partes del río bueno esto es básicamente que lo que les dije son unos 150 años de historia de california en cuanto a gestión del agua ahora en gestión del agua en lo que hacemos es ver la parte del medio bueno el común el ciclo del agua de forma natural y después ver cómo cuáles son los procesos para manejar esta agua cristian esa pregunta lo voy a responder un poquito más tarde es un poquito más éste especifica bueno lo que ustedes ven aquí es como son los procesos naturales es decir un río responde de minutos horas hasta casi años es decir desde que llueve y como el agua se va moviendo en los ríos como llegan tiene esa variación y tiene una variación espacial desde casi una hectárea hasta los kilómetros cuadrados no miles de kilómetros cuadrados esto será el escurrimiento esto será la parte de aguas subterráneas es esperar la parte de cobertura del suelo esto es como que la parte este natural si lo hubiéramos con los procesos que nosotros utilizamos en el caso de mitigación de inundaciones o manejo de inundaciones esto viene de la parte bueno la operación la hacemos en horas minutos a días y bueno nosotros hacemos análisis en décadas para ver cuáles son las lluvias de retorno en cuanto a operación la operación la hacemos de días y semanas la operación aunque nos cuando nosotros queramos hacer una operación de canales presas es más o menos de ese orden y bueno estamos hablando de microcuencas al tamaño de un tributario más o menos y en la operación lo que decidimos es necesitamos generar estos manuales de operación en instrucciones detalladas y la operación día a día eso es diferente a la parte de planeación en planeación nosotros estamos hablando de semanas fabricadas y mamá pero en general estamos hablando más de temporadas años la planeación está más de este lado y el tipo de decisiones que hacemos son son reglamentos es como que reglas de quién va a usar agua primero después en caso de sequía en caso de excedente estas son políticas de mediano a largo plazo y bueno esto nos ayuda para definir ciertas inversiones aquí lo que me gustaría es que tanto la página web que están en la conagua eso es un poco más para operar y tiene cierto ciertos beneficios lo que estamos haciendo con el modelo de planeación y todo bien es cierto objetivo que sería el mediano a largo plazo al otro es un poco al corto y en el que ustedes tengan muy muy claro eso porque en general luego están uno confunde de que a bueno es una operación está diciendo en planeación la planeación es un poco pues está más grandes gana [Música] bueno diego ahorita también tienen que responder esa pregunta acerca de los de la modelación si tiene razón de hecho todos los datos de entrada tienen cierto por 200 problemas o cierta incertidumbre esa la podemos ir viendo pero sobre todo a nivel mensual y anual ahí es cuando se cuando se hace todos los balances los los water bots allí no se dan cuenta que también lo que está en mal estado bueno esto sería para la parte agrícola ambiental y energía pero aquí lo que quiero tienes que es súper claro es que operación y planeación van de la mano pero no se traslapan mucho y en general pueden ser dos dos temas distintos uno hace la planeación y después ve como uno hacer los manuales para hacer la operación bueno estaremos aquí en manejo de las cuencas esto es lo que está pasando ahorita en el aconcagua y esto pasa en todas las cuencas es decir primero se hace la medición de datos y después se hará el proceso de generar las bases de datos y hacer guardar todos esos esos datos el análisis que es con los modelos que hemos estado trabajando de nube escurrimiento planeación modelos hidráulicos después de eso ya viene la toma de decisiones y después de la toma de decisiones viene la implementación y nuevamente ahí nos vamos al monitoreo y luego los datos análisis y sistematización esto usualmente este proceso es un proceso que no tiene nada que ver con la naturaleza es un proceso de la administración usualmente se administra en los en la duración de las administraciones es decir si es cada cuatro años cuando en todos estos procesos se hacen cada cuatro años o cada cinco años y aquí lo que es súper importante es que bueno pues nosotros o el equipo de davis que nosotros hemos estado trabajando en esta parte de medición bueno los usuarios han estado en la medición nosotros en el procesamiento y análisis y esta parte de la toma de decisiones es una de dos o se dan desde un punto de vista reglamentario o sea que existe una ley dice que hay que hacer algo o se dan desde un punto de vista de incentivos cuando la gente se da cuenta que trabajando en conjunto pueden tener más o mejores beneficios que que trabajarán de forma distinta no gracias aquí es súper importante mencionar que en el tiempo de este proyecto pues es de vida relativamente corto comparado con lo que usualmente se da en estos procesos de gestión de la cuenta no les voy a hablar un poquito acerca de gobernanza y espero dentro de muy poco ya cambiarle al en river este es el estado de california no y lo que nosotros necesitamos es vamos a hacer una decisión y estamos tomar una decisión este es el proceso de decisión o sea existe una ley o existe algún reglamento o algún incentivo en el cual en alguna en alguna fecha vamos a tomar una decisión usualmente considera los usuarios y vende diferentes alternativas y les digo al final es una decisión o un reglamento o un acuerdo o vamos a invertir dinero y aquí lo que viene es que tenemos los tomadores de decisiones y estos tomadores de decisiones usualmente necesitan información tenemos a los científicos a los ingenieros y los ingenieros bueno pues tratarán de proveer esta información a los tomadores de decisión los científicos la verdad es que nosotros nos la pasamos pensando en nuestros modelos y cómo hacer números arriba y abajo pero la verdad es que los tomadores de decisiones aparte de los modelos bueno están viendo cuánto les cuesta y cuál es el los votantes en el sector al que ello representa cuándo van a ser las próximas elecciones y cuál es el el tiempo no solamente el tiempo del proyecto pero los tiempos electorales y así no todo esto que les estoy diciendo que son los usuarios las distintas leyes y las instituciones que que hay participan en esta toma de decisiones todo eso se llama gobernanza del agua o sea esa descripción del proceso de la gente que participa y las instituciones es la gobernando y todo esto está dentro de un contexto social político y ambiental es decir no es lo mismo las piezas compartimos una misma un contexto físico y ambiental entre chile-california pero el contexto social y económico político son distintas y bueno aquí que sale lo último que les voy a hablar de aquí es acerca de las instituciones cada una de ellas tiene un rol y una responsabilidad es decir algunas son agencias que abastecen el agua una institución gubernamental financiera de ciencia o una organización de usuarios y sus responsabilidades pueden ser designación operación planeación pueden ser reguladores pueden ser este su responsabilidad puede ser financiar proveer irrigación o la transferencia de científicos y conocimiento no el problema es que como se darán cuentas por ejemplo aquí el vídeo reclamation no está en la parte alta de la cuenta binacional es una agencia que hace abastecimiento de agua y solamente se designa a asignación operación y planeación pero no hace ni regulación de financiamiento ni irrigación hay otros que harán irrigación y habrá otros que harán esta regulación lo que les quiero decir es que las responsabilidades y los roles se fragmentan y el y entonces el problema de que está esto es que yo la próxima bala la mano derecha le tiene que pedir permiso a la mano izquierda y eso es por a veces por los cuales la gestión es un poco más tardada y esto es esto es un ejemplo de alejandra cuñada le ha hecho estos estudios donde por ejemplo para la explotación de recursos hídricos se tiene la dga la de hojas el indap y la de hojancha y cada uno tienes ciertos tipos de actividades para hacer explotación o abuso de los recursos hídricos les digo es esto es común bueno hay que hacer e involucrar los usuarios puede ser usual usualmente hay dos formas de hacerlo una desde el gobierno hacia los usuarios que es top down o un x de los usuarios y que le presenten sus propuestas a la parte gubernamental que se llama botón en para estructurar el proyecto desde estructura centralizada descentralizada viene déjenme hablarles de la cuenca de gilbert en los últimos 10 minutos esta es una cuenta que está en california está aquí en esta esquinita de todo california está en esta esquina y esta es una cuenta que va que fluye del sur al norte ok esta cuenca que le estoy hablando es esta cuenta de aquí es el y se le llama fork porque tiene como si fuera un tenedor tiene el software el mid of work y el north fork ya tiene tres tres ramas principales como cada rama no le querían llamar distinto entonces tienes el show del miedo y el north fork vale aquí sea bueno sea en california se ha cultivado media marihuana cannabis desde 1795 se legalizó su uso medicinal en el 96 y su uso recreacional en el 2016 a la hora de legalizar el uso represión también se hizo lado el cultivo no se estima que por ejemplo web en el 2010 el 80 por ciento de la producción de marihuana que se consume en los estados unidos venía de esta zona que es donde el river que estamos hablando este de aquí es donde ven todos estos puntos de aquí y aquí es donde está el river es una industria de 10 a 15 millones de 15.000 en millones de dólares para que ustedes tengan una una proporción de toda la industria agrícola son 30 billones y ésta les le va a echar encima 15 más pues es la mitad de la agricultura en el valor económico de la agricultura en california en todos estos usuarios que ustedes ven aquí siempre han existido desde estos desde 1975 había muchos de estos agricultores ya aquí lo que quiere hacer ahorita la autoridad es darles un permiso para que puedan extraer agua de forma legal no es que no no extrajeran a guantes y si lo hacían por acción de forma ilegal este entonces el contexto de lo que les voy a platicar es como generar una la toma de decisiones o el proceso es necesita y vamos a ver a quién le damos un derecho de agua y bajo qué condiciones lo que está es la toma de decisiones entonces nosotros les estamos ayudando a construir los modelos y toda la información para que los tomadores de decisiones hagan esa decisión aquí se ve el river está con la parte alta ustedes se dan cuenta cómo esta causa vemos muy chico esté a salvo no los tributarios y bueno pues el agua bajando el river está encañonado están 50 este será un poco más abajo se darán cuenta que por ejemplo estas épocas de central baja poca agua pero el agua puede llegar hasta estos niveles y después bueno sobrepasar está dentro de un sistema el boscoso y todo esto es hombre le ayuda a los sobre todo a los peces a los salmones a vivir bien ahora estamos en un poco en la parte más baja y normalmente sigue viendo este por algunos ya tenemos algunos bancos pulsan grifos ok fernández carlos esas preguntas responder un poquito después estoy pidiendo todas las preguntas esto ya es la parte más baja y aquí es cuando hay más tributarios bajando esta ya es nuevamente ya en la parte más baja y todo esto es para migración migración de salmones aquí lo que se está haciendo es proteger media mente cuando les estaba hablando acerca de todos estos usuarios que quieren estimar un derecho de agua pero están solicitando un derecho de agua el gobierno lo que tiene que hacer o lo que está haciendo es decidir cuánta agua tiene que dejar en el río para proteger al medio ambiente y el agua que sea beneficiar para el medio ambiente la que está por encima de ese volumen entonces se le puede asignar a los usuarios pues eso es lo que está haciendo por eso es que estamos haciendo toda esta caracterización esta es en la parte más baja aquí se ven esta es una producción e índoles un green house un pequeño vivero para pues cultivaron la siembra de marihuana y bueno pues aquí se ve que puede haber tanto autor que son estas plantaciones afuera como la de indoor que están entonces hay que determinar estos caudales ambientales caudales ecológicos con base en eso después ver cuánta agua se le puede dar a los usuarios para eso estamos desarrollando un sistema regional para un método regional para determinar caudales ecológicos y esto lo estamos haciendo de forma de guías no qué es lo que estamos haciendo pues básicamente estamos primero esta parte de aquí que será la parte ideológica no estamos construyendo modelos de precipitación y con variables atmosféricas modelos de hugh escurrimiento y agua subterránea después en la parte de medioambiental lo que estamos haciendo es haciendo una clasificación geomorfológica es decir como se ve el río cuál es la forma más fácil de decirles esto es que ustedes se pusieron unos goles y mete en la cabeza al río y cómo se vería el río por abajo o cuando lo vimos seco no cómo es cuál es la la topografía no en cómo hacen esto hacer modelación hidráulica y ver cuál es la respuesta de los en este caso de los salmones a la cantidad de agua y a la forma del río y luego la tercera parte que es la estimar las demandas y estrategias de planeación y todo esto lo estamos haciendo en este modelo de disponibilidad para el southport con todos estos proyectos y estamos tratando bueno estamos construir una interfase para los usuarios así es como se ve la hidrología natural en california de esta tecnología natural podemos encontrar nueve regímenes de flujo naturales es decir nueve formas en las cuales el río escurre desde la parte aníbal la parte de lluvia y luego la mezcla entre lluvia y nieve ríos efímeros así se ve esta zona este es un régimen de que tiene lluvias al principio y luego tiene el derretimiento aníbal en esta parte son ríos de este río azul a sólo un poco más oscuro y a todos ellos les hemos encontrado ciertas en ciertas épocas hemos encontrado eventos o características que son beneficia les para el medio ambiente es decir un caudal base en la época de fijación caudal más en la época de lluvias la transición entre caudales altos y caudales bajo los estos escurrimientos que ayudan a mover sedimentos estas primeras lluvias que ayudan a mover la calidad del agua todo esto con estos con la caracterización de esto se puede generar un este régimen medioambiental se puede determinar el caudal medioambiental el caudal ecológico y bueno pues básicamente todas estas métricas la relación se dirige estimado a cada 200 metros en todos los ríos de california todos los ríos de california tienen esto esto es algo que lo acabamos de hacer lo hemos hecho como en cuatro o cinco años no están tan lejos de hacer algo así he intentado en dos o tres ocasiones trabajar en proyectos para hacer la clasificación de ríos y luego hacer estas métricas no están no estamos tan lejos en fin [Música] con claudio con qué criterios técnicos se toman la acción de cuánta agua necesaria dejar en los ríos de nuestras fuentes y luego explicar ahorita miren lo que vamos a hacer sobre todo parece que esta parte es quién es esto solamente si ustedes se dan cuenta esto de aquí es la pura parte de cantidad de agua ok no solamente se necesita cantidad pero se necesita tener buen cauce y como el cauce y la cantidad van a ayudar a responder al hablarles del medio ambiente para responder a la pregunta de claudio tenemos ciertas curvas de preferencia en las cuales vemos cómo responden los peces o no sería muy bien pero sería muy mal dependiendo a la velocidad o la profundidad del próximo los con eso lo que se puede hacer es ver de forma espacial en estos lugares rojitos o amarillos donde se tiene mejor y mejoramiento para los peces que en otros lugares esto lo hemos hecho mediante clasificación es decir fuimos a los ríos y medimos hicimos secciones más ver sales y después clasificamos los tipos de ríos entonces tenemos en este en este río tenemos siete clases de forma de río jerte geomorfología y a cada una de ellas la vamos a hacer una extra quita finca mediana grande grande osa el tamaño del río lo vamos a escalar y vamos a correr en modelos hidrológicos para ver cómo responden los los los peces los criterios técnicos es que nosotros le damos a los tomadores de decisiones una curva de respuesta y el tomador de decisiones dirá bueno si quiero tener una respuesta muy muy buena esta es la cantidad que tengo que dejar y esto es lo que queda disponible para los usuarios porque los dejo - y ellos son los que van a tomar la decisión es importante decirles que los tomadores de decisiones les gusta tomar decisiones si no les dicen que hacer se enojan mucho entonces nosotros les explicamos cuál sería la respuesta que los tomadores de acciones deben de hacerse responsables de las decisiones que toman básicamente este es el sistema que estamos utilizando aquí estamos haciendo lo toma de datos de precipitación a temperatura caudales evapotranspiración estamos haciendo todo el procesamiento y almacenamiento de esa información el análisis que le dije con les dije con los modelos la toma de decisiones y la implementación y básicamente es lo que les digo aquí el proceso de toma decisiones es que el 2016 se aprobó la el uso recreacional o para adultos y se aprobó también la cultivo y debido a eso entonces se tiene que ahora te buscar la protección del medio ambiente y al final la toma de decisiones es cuánta agua es elevada aquí la alternativa es que en épocas de lluvia se va a permitir lo están pensando permitir de almacenamiento micro almacenamiento pequeños points tranquilas pequeños este y reservorios que se puede almacenar el agua a tanques y ya después en la época de estiaje donde no llueve solamente utilizar agua de los tanques no no no sacar nada de agua de los ríos esa esa es una de las opciones tenemos los tomadores de decisiones stewart visores control board básicamente nosotros que es el grupo de davis les yayi y utah state y bueno pues todo lo que hemos estado haciendo el trabajo esto lo tenemos que terminar para el año que entra en 2021 en él [Música] estoy en 32 minutos quizás está es la parte más importante en la gente no importa qué tanto sabes a la gente la gente quiere saber qué tanto te importa los huincas que estás trabajando entonces bueno pues hasta lo dejaría muchas muchas gracias tengo por aquí varias preguntas él [Música] aunque criterios técnicos se toman la decisión de cuánta agua necesaria dejar en los ríos los criterios técnicos de lo que tengo la respuesta y los tomadores de decisiones ven aquí cuál es la respuesta que quieren tener en el río en chile tenemos un código de agua desde 1981 basado en condiciones solo en consideraciones jurídicas desde julio sin tomar en cuenta la observación de la naturaleza de las necesidades reales de riesgo los derechos fueron dados a perpetuidad y también aquí super triste y con la sequía existen derechos sobre agua que físicamente ya no existe también aquí es sobre concesionamiento políticamente hablando es muy complejo hacer las reformas al código hablar de dolor de derogarlo es impronunciable los dueños de los derechos alegan que si el estado se los quiere expropiar debe pagarlos ángel muy complejo no sé si usted tiene alguna idea si tú tienes alguna idea de que suponga una solución a esta problemática aquí lo que se necesita hacer es un poco más de conciliación lo que te decía es que o sea 'una tienes tú tienes dos herramientas básicamente un es el martillo y la otra es una zanahoria d las leyes es el martillo las leyes en inglés le llaman este es el es la vara con la que te pegan y el carro es la zanahoria son los incentivos entonces existe incentivos para que puedan trabajar juntos y puedan y eso es básicamente y revisarlo qué tipo de cultivo revisar cuál va a ser el abastecimiento durante sequías cómo se va a distribuirla en la falta de agua en sequías eso puede ser incentivos pero en general siempre se hace de los dos lados hay que poner error sanabria se enfrente también atrás es el estado en el movimiento flow que es maría angélica elemental flower que señala es equivalente al caudal ambiental que consiste que considera la evaluación ambiental de un proyecto si es correcto que tiene de forma en que tiene un fundamento más ecosistémico también eso es correcto ok mira te voy a explicar en muy rápidos en el fundamento legal que tenemos existen en california no existe una ley en chile o en otros países sino lo que existe son muchos casos que fueron ligados en la corte y como el caso pasó o se quitó a ese se encienda precedente entonces lo que tenemos es una serie de casos que hay que leer para ver cómo se asigna el agua uno de los casos que una de las reglas es que el uso para beneficio público es más importante o está por encima del uso para beneficio de privados eso fue un pleito legal y se gana si entonces lo que sucede es que el luso medioambiental está el preservar al medio ambiente está en una prioridad más alta que el lujo para particulares en este momento en particular quiere obtener un derecho de agua para evitar lo que tú dices que ahora te lo voy a quitar porque quiero proteger el medio ambiente primero estamos estimando el uso medioambiental para evitar eso ok es un criterio de lo lógico y sí que es un criterio hidrológico y que al ser obligatorio a veces se tienen que se piden por ejemplo tres metros de agua en un caudal ecológico de la dga es varias magnitudes mayores del caudal solicitado y uniforme para cualquier tramo así no se tiene se necesita hacer una variabilidad lo que les digo y si hay algo aquí que también quiero quedar súper claro es que la experiencia en california en caudales ecológicos es un espejo en el en el sur los nueve los nueve regímenes de flujo que hemos encontrado en california muy probablemente sean muy parecidos o los mismos en en chile eso me quedó súper claro que se necesita variabilidad temporal en los los reservorios perjudican la circulación de los carbones de los alemanes y si está el reservorio en atravesado en el cauce sí porque evita la conectividad y sin embargo si haces empresas que se llama offspring hacen en las laderas de estos tanques en las laderas puedes sacar agua del cauce cuando hay mucha agua y la puedes guardar ahí esta es una de las soluciones que hemos visto estas soluciones son lo que les llamaban soluciones que no son este son distribuir o sea son soluciones son prácticas distribuidas cómo han influido a la de las demandas civiles en tribunales para proteger a los caudales ecológicos bueno esto fue básicamente un pleito que se le ganó a los ángeles los ángeles traía agua de mono lake en las organismos medioambientales lo demandaron 18 años después ganaron y fue así cómo han influido estas demandas civiles pero lo que les quiero dejar es que no es uno u otro si puede haber beneficio o sea si puede haber un buen medio ambiente y en este caso uso agrícola sin estar en conflicto lo que es lo que se necesita es como ponerse de acuerdo en cuándo sacar agua en dónde utilizarla y todo esto no es un que vamos a pelearnos si existe si existen acuerdos lo que se necesita hacer pues es es voluntad no aquí se está tratando de poner esto antes de que se vayan a incorporar otros criterios en relación a la biodiversidad además de los movimientos de peces microorganismos algas leche ajá si miran claudia en lo que pasa es que el pce es el bio indicador y es en lo cual tenemos una respuesta física pero el pez es el que va adelante de todo es el que lo utiliza como indicador de todos los demás y si se necesita tanto la producción de fitoplancton zooplancton movimiento de sedimento todo eso lo estamos o sea se considera en algunos casos de forma explícita a otros de forma implícita el cristiano de porcentaje de agua usada se asocia a la actividad agrícola a quien porcentaje del agua usada se asocia lo que mira aquí realmente la cantidad de agua que se utiliza en esta cuenta y es poca con respecto a la cantidad natural el problema de esta cuenca tienen fluye alrededor de 5 a 6 kilómetros cúbicos en el aconcagua tiene un kilómetro 1.7 1.5 kilómetros cúbicos esto es mucho más grande el problema es que el 85% de estos 5 kilómetros cúbicos fluye solamente en 3 a 4 meses el 15 por ciento es en la época de sequía es una cuenta que es muy muy muy variable entonces claro en ese 15 por ciento pues todos están peleando el agua cuando no llueve y debido a eso es por eso que se están buscando estas otras alternativas al igual que proteger al medio ambiente en realidad muchas gracias emilio está considerada como consideran la variabilidad calidad físico-química de las aguas en la toma de decisiones ok estamos también haciendo modelación de temperatura porque los salmones necesitan cierta temperatura y les está diciendo en que los ríos lado la cobertura de los bosques ribereños ayuda mucho porque evita que el agua se caliente entonces si se está haciendo la modelación el este son un paso fail porque sí o sea si te pasas de la temperatura en el río aquí no es que vayan a sobrevivir sino todos se mueren entonces esa es cómo se necesita esta temperatura y para esta temperatura hay que tener esta cobertura y estos son la sitio donde no se tiene y ahí lo que hay que hacer de restauración hay quien a plantar los árboles hola muchas gracias por el seminario mi pregunta es nahuel que lo clara emilio ok me preguntáis si tienen en consideración la utilización de humedales para la distribución temporal del agua siempre solo los humedales son hasta en la parte baja esta zona cuenta que está súper superastro para encañonada océanos y pueda ver si existen humedales pero serían un poquito más delgadito y acostumbrados a los que tenemos un poco más grandes y para calidad del agua uno de los problemas que se tienen que fuerte es que la como la agricultura está en la parte alta de la montaña cuando llueve y aplican pesticidas fertilizantes se escurren a siempre de ese tamaño hay beneficios o fragmentos en este momento en eeuu estás matías para proyectos privados a escala pequeña de acumuladores de agua si existe el día y a veces provee incentivos o dinero o materiales para generar este tipo de estanques de tranques no esto es no están no están 5 no es tan difícil si existen incentivos realmente lo que se hace en el incentivo es uno a uno o sea el agricultor pone puede ser un dólar o este un beso y puede ser en forma de horas de trabajo y el estado pone en la misma cantidad se podría decir que las soluciones que están poniendo han utilizado el concepto de soluciones basadas en la naturaleza si saben si la verdad es que si algo que me queda muy claro es que el problema no es echarle concreto después vamos a pagar para tratar de volver a proveer los mismos beneficios que la naturaleza nos daba estaba hablando con él era agua nutriente de recarga de acuíferos ahorita estamos viendo en proyectos para recargar acuíferos cuando la naturaleza no lo hacía de gratis estamos en eso y tratar de no ir a ese lugar sino ver un poquito más adelante para conservar esos sitios de recarga de acuíferos para que no no tengamos después que pagar para eso hoy tengamos es el agente que paga impuestos isabel se podría decir que la solución no es hoy son matías muchas gracias por la presentación mauricio tolosa ya lo conocía antes buenas tardes en california se restringe la superficie cultivar bueno eso no no se restringe y ese ha sido el problema del vice central forever en el programa que vimos del valle central de que se estaba hundiendo es porque nunca se ha restringido la agrícola ahora ya está lo que se va a manejar por lo que estaban finalmente manejando es el el este la cantidad de agua y para serte sincero en algunas zonas de california donde vimos que estaba esa sobreexplotación se les va a recortar el agua se les y es muy probable que aunque en esta zona casi una cuarta parte de la de una quinta parte a una décima parte de las hectáreas se va a recortar porque sí o sea hay mucho más cantidad que de superficie de riego tenemos que seguir con la prenda solamente de lo que queda una pregunta que escapa un poco la que estaba haciendo antes y tiene que ver sobre de hecho la última cual es la capacidad computacional es elevar el almacenamiento y procesamiento de datos donde se realizan más allá de la parte investigación me gustaría enfocar esa pregunta si es que también cubre eso en cómo sé dónde están almacena toda la decisión a nivel en este caso estatal que tiene lo podríamos incluso dar un nivel nacional cuál sería la agencia involucradas de hacerlo primero de eso si ya cambiamos la agencia se llaman este resort ses control board la agencia estatal de que maneja los derechos de agua ellos son los que hacen o reúne entonces a tomas de decisiones la modelación y los y los datos quizás aquí algo de los mensajes como que me gustaría dejarles es no es una es toda la parte política o de decisiones de reglas se entiende por un lado y el otro es la parte un poco más técnica de dónde están las oportunidades todos estos modelos y todo no lo sé yo sé que los dos van de la mano y sin embargo ahí lo que me gustaría decirles es que no porque no se pueda de forma legislativa o de forma regulatoria no es no es necesario no no podemos explorar la de forma técnica o sea podemos adelantarnos ver qué estrategias funcionan o no y después de ahí ver cómo se puede modificar cambiar los cambios o sea si se hace un cambio se puede ser un incremento no cambia la ley actual la otra pues el borrón y cuenta nueva será una nueva ley y eso es un poco más difícil entonces dentro de estas estrategias hay que ver cuáles es necesita un cambio incremental hoy es también dentro del reglamento y cuál es sin estar en un cambio general y ahí yo lo que es más más que decirles que no vayan por todo es que al contrario hay que explorarlo hay muchas gracias muchas gracias a todos gracias gracias por la presentación excelente para nosotros también es decir es poder tener la experiencia de las distintas las distintas temáticas bueno siguiendo siguiendo con nuestra agenda ahora que puede dejar con ustedes la presentación de la doctora alejandra cugno alejandra alejandra es la encargada de este la gestión de este proyecto desde yusidey visible alejandra la la coordinadora agronómica de lúcida y visible del centro del centro universal y fomenta lavanchy la que también llegó hace cinco años a chile apoyado también por corfo en realidad como muchas cosas en este país y eso siempre es bueno alejandra sin más presentación de juego [Música] con todo el escenario virtual tuyo gracias a mauricio déjenme compartir mi pantalla y poner mi timing bueno perderme en el tiempo ok bueno primero quiero darles la bienvenida a todos y a todas las que están conectadas hoy día con nosotros y contarles un poco desde la mirada del centro este proyecto que se llama central de información y modelación hídrica si me como un proyecto colaborativo en la cuenca del aconcagua la agenda en estos 20 minutos la presentación que voy a tener con ustedes es un poco contarles que yo si baby chiles y situarlos en el aconcagua que es en la localidad la cual nosotros estamos ejecutando el proyecto contables del proyecto cine que es el proyecto cine que significa los datos que tiene en línea la modelación o simulación que hemos venido trabajando con sammy con javier ahí les voy a contar un poco más de nuestros equipos de trabajo la gobernanza y modelos de sustentabilidad la metodología de trabajo que aquí quiero agradecer mucho a los equipos de las juntas de vigilancia de la primera la segunda la tercera sección y también putaendo también quiero agradecer el apoyo del per frutícola de corfo y de la dirección general de agua ha sido un trabajo colaborativo por eso quiero hacer a todos es fácil mi presentación con respecto a esto lo que les voy a presentar ahora es un trabajo de equipo de un grupo de personas y luego un resumen y relevando los puntos más importantes y los agradecimientos bueno qué yusidei de chile como comentaba mauricio y ossie davis chile es un centro de la universidad de california davis que está acá en chile y quiere financiado desde el año 2015 por corfo y que tiene como misión entregar al mercado de la sociedad soluciones tecnológicas basadas en la ciencia a través de la investigación colaborativa el desarrollo y la transferencia de tecnología además generó el impacto económico y desarrollo social en tres áreas ambiente agricultura y alimentos el proyecto que les voy a presentar hoy día está diría que en esta intersección entre ambiente y agricultura nosotros trabajamos desde la investigación el desarrollo la innovación y extensión y la transferencia tecnológica y vamos construyendo puentes entre equipos de trabajo de california davis y aquí y nuestros socios en chiles bueno el aconcagua la cuenca del aconcagua como información general la superficie total de la cuenca es de más de 7.000 kilómetros cuadrados que incluye 5 provincias valparaíso marga marga quillota san felipe y los andes estas cinco provincias corresponden e incluyen 20 comunas que van desde quintero en el poniente hasta rinconada en el oriente con un total de habitante la sumatoria de cada una de las provincias que nos da más de un millón y medio de habitantes las principales industrias está la minería agrícolas y su ganado italia la extensión del río aconcagua es de 399 mil metros infracción 399 kilómetros con un caudal medio promedio histórico del 31,1 metros cúbicos por segundo es el valor tomado en chacabuco el aporte recibe como dos ríos no más importante el río colorado de putaendo como ríos de aporte al aconcagua y en el lago la cuenta tiene variada un lado en montañoso pero el más importante es la laguna del inca que tiene un área de 17 kilómetros cuadrados el aconcagua tiene como agrupaciones aquí pueden ver a la izquierda de la diapositiva varias agrupaciones con algún grado de personalidad jurídica y si se dan cuenta la mayoría de las agrupaciones en la cuenca están relacionados al agua son un total de 379 agrupaciones de la cuenca y 1 293 están asociadas al agua entiéndase por asociaciones de canalistas junta de vigilancia pr etcétera ahora bien enfocándonos en la producción agrícola si ustedes ven en el eje de las íes por provincia están todas las provincias que incluye la cuenta y en el eje de las equis van a encontrar el porcentaje de los productores agrícolas de cada una de las provincias se fijan en la provincia de marga marga y quillota son las provincias que albergan la mayor cantidad de pequeños agricultores quise hacer este hincapié en esta información porque la información que nosotros desplegamos en la página web es para todo tipo de usuario y la idea es alcanzar no sólo los usuarios a los grandes productores articulaciones que también a los pequeños la información hidrométrica sanitaria publicada por la dirección general de agua en su ficha para la cuenca incluye 27 26 estaciones de medición con el código prefijo 0 54 en su página web agua potable urbana hay 200 más de 227.000 arranques que abastecen a 758 mil y fracción persona habitante el resto se surte con aguas potables rurales están organizadas alrededor de 81 pozos el proyecto sin mí es un proyecto de la línea de bien público apoyado por corfo el acrónimo si me significa central de información y modelación hídrica como ya saben este este proyecto está ejecutado por el centro y occidente chile cuyo mandante la dirección general de agua los coejecutores son las tres secciones de la junta de vigilancia del aconcagua y los asociados ha interesado está el programa estratégico regional de fruticultura sustentable de valparaíso esval y la junta de vigilancia el río putaendo y codelco el período de ejecución de este proyecto es desde diciembre de 2018 hasta noviembre del 2021 en el proyecto si me tiene como principal objetivo es el objetivo general desarrollar e implementar una plataforma web de hidrometría superficial subterránea en tiempo real para fortalecer la gestión sustentable del agua y dar apoyo a la toma de decisiones en distribución y uso del recurso hídrico este proyecto tiene cuatro etapas que parten en diciembre del 2018 y terminan en noviembre del 2021 y los quiero situar un poco que es lo que nosotros hemos venido haciendo como trabajo en equipo ha sido primero la etapa 1 en la cual se desarrolló el bien público se eligió modelo se tomó un modelo entregado con la dirección general de agua que se denomina uip modo flow nativo y además se habilitó una plataforma web de información que les voy a explicar a continuación en esta etapa de final listo para pasar a la etapa 2 y es de transferencia y en lo que hemos estado haciendo estos meses tenemos tres manuales de operación de la página web estamos trabajando en vídeos de funcionamiento que vamos a colocar a disposición en la página web y en tanto del modelo como de la página web en sí y estamos partiendo la etapa número 3 de difusión en la cual tenemos una batería de talleres de operación y aplicación ya en forma paralela hemos y él ha sustentado el tiempo el proyecto propiamente tal y esta es la página web para que ustedes la tengan y puedan consultarla y puedan ver de qué se trata como ustedes pueden ver acá en esta foto tiene varias pestañas está la información en línea en la cual pueden ver todas las estaciones que tenemos incluidas en la página web las estaciones incluidas en la de que son de la dirección general de agua las estaciones de la junta de vigilancia la sección 1 de la sección 2 y de la sección 3 ellas ubicadas geográficamente dentro de este mapa que se despliega una vez que ustedes hacen clic en la página de inicio también tenemos una pestaña de reporte una pestaña de históricos e históricos de datos que van desde el año 2018 en adelante a la fecha y de simulación o modelación con el modelo que les mencionaba anteriormente with modo flow más nativo que incluye datos desde el año 1950 a la fecha ya acá también está la pestaña proyecto que cuenta que es el proyecto en detalle y recursos que es la que nosotros denominamos nuestra biblioteca digital ahora las estadísticas del uso web del uso de esta página web les quiero dar 22 un poco de atención fíjense que la mayoría de los usuarios de la página web desde noviembre a la fecha se conectan a través de sus teléfonos de su de sus teléfonos celulares de sus móviles y sólo un 28% de su computador ya eso habla de que el usuario está constantemente consultando la página a través de su teléfono la otra imagen muestra que desde noviembre a la fecha tenemos 72 3% de nuevos visitantes de la página y de visitantes que siempre nos están [Música] consultando la página de un 27% ya tenemos un público cautivo de alrededor 30 por ciento ahora cuál es la magnitud de los datos que esta página despliega ya hay un total de 60 estaciones de medición de las cuales 19 corresponden a la dirección general de agua 22 a la junta de vigilancia en la primera sección del río aconcagua 18 a la a la segunda sección de del río aconcagua a la junta de vigilancia y una a la junta de vigilancia de la tercera sección si ustedes ven a su derecha esta tabla la construir para que tengan una idea de qué parámetros mide en relación a cuánto número de estaciones y los parámetros que miden tenemos que la mayoría de las estaciones lo que nos entrega es caudal en metros cúbicos por segundo pero también hay estaciones que nos entregan información de nieve información de precipitación acumulada y otras como nivel de agua en el caso de las estaciones subterráneas ahora con relación a los reportes y esto son documentos que o muy bien [Música] formatos de información que los mismos usuarios nos han ido solicitando con el tiempo aquí ustedes pueden ver que uno puede solicitar las estaciones de los datos instantáneos haciendo clic en aconcagua san felipe aconcagua romeral colocando el periodo y haciendo clic en descargar el reporte y ustedes van a observar un documento como como el que observar en el ala derecha de la de la figura aquí están los datos para con cagua para san felipe y para cóncavo romeral en la última semana registrada del mes de agosto y también pueden ver los datos históricos yo les comentaba que existen los datos históricos para las estaciones de aconcagua chaca boquita oncca o romeral y san felipe desde el año 2018 a la fecha y también los históricos de las estaciones que se despliegan en la figura ya pueden ustedes hacer clic desde 5 minutos hasta los últimos 5 años la central de información y modelación hídrica tiene una pestaña denominada simulación con modelación en esta pestaña nosotros utilizamos las salidas de un modelo que se llama with modo flow nativo que fue entregado por la dirección general de aguas al equipo de trabajo de virus y davis en diciembre del año 2019 esta posibilidad tiene como fin explicarle en palabras bien simples lo que hace este modelo ya a través de un flujo de trabajo y entre paréntesis yo les puse un display med para que tengan muy claro que en la página web los datos que se observan en simulación son las salidas de este modelo ya este modelo funciona con input mensuales de evaporación de dos estaciones de la energía bill cuya idiota y también de las estaciones de precipitación san felipe putaendo en recuerdo los patos y limache las cuales son procesados en ml python y lo anterior ingresa como correctiva escorrentía superficial y subterránea cuencas de entrada y laterales entran al modelo uip que el modelo subterráneo que ocupa el módulo nativo y el cual a su vez van a ingresando los datos de evapotranspiración de cultivo en los sectores de riego que están determinados por esto por este por defaul yo en este modelo y también los caudales de estaciones fluido métricas que son las más consultada y las más comunes en la cuenca del aconcagua que son chacabuco romeral y san felipe e ingresan a este modelo este modelo alimenta la recarga subterránea y el cual se trabaja en otro sistema que se llama grand water visto en versión 7 y entrega a los niveles de agua subterránea en 56 puntos y además para poder nosotros entender como equipo cómo funciona el modelo realizamos en conjunto con javier tamaño en nuestro hidrólogo un diagrama bonificar el cual va mostrando como ustedes pueden ver en la simbología los embales las laterales los sectores de riego los tramos de río y los acuíferos que son los chats los sectores de hidrológicos de aprovechamiento común y la escorrentía superficial y si se fijan nosotros lo que hicimos para poder entender bien el modelo fue hacer un esquema en forma bien simple desde oriente hasta poniente incluyendo las demandas y las ofertas del modelo en cuanto a agua una vez que entendimos bien el modelo superficial lo que hicimos fue hacer una corrida histórica desde el año 1950 hasta el 2018 en primera instancia y el que ahora estamos trabajando en la corrida desde el inicio del 2019 hasta en marzo del 2020 ya si ustedes se fijan en esta figura pueden observar los datos simulados en azul y los datos observados en rojo y si se fijan el modelo entregado por la dga se ajusta muy bien a lo que realmente ocurrió ya aquello hay un leve desfase entre los años 90 y 94 ya nosotros confeccionamos esta figura y la entregamos al equipo y el grupo de discusión de una forma de que entendieran de que el modelo si simula lo que efectivamente ocurre ya también hicimos cálculos de estadísticos de ajuste que en específico la junta de vigilancia en la segunda sección nos pidió ya por tiempo no les voy a mostrar pero fueron los estadísticos nativos los que calculamos con respecto a la gobernanza y el modelo sustentabilidad de este proyecto colaborativo nosotros partimos identificando los factores relevantes en la cuenca y luego nos fuimos acercando en forma más local a lo que pudiese ser nuestra forma legal de corporación y es lo que nosotros estamos tratando de armar para poder asegurar la sustentabilidad del proyecto que lo que siempre discutimos en las reuniones para nosotros es tener algún grado de sustentabilidad del proyecto necesitamos algún grado de gobernanza y esa gobernanza la estamos logrando con los actores relevantes en la cuenca qué son las juntas de vigilancia principalmente y el programa estratégico regional fruticultura sustentable para la quinta región sin dejar de lado la figura de un consejo asesor que tenga en dentro de este consejo asesor universidades que tengan presencia local la dh la comisión nacional de riego representantes de las comunidades de agua subterránea que se están conformando recientemente las empresas que tienen interés en reforzar sus lazos con actores relevantes en la cuenca como es code con minería y también como eje fall como empresa sanitaria dentro de la gobernación modelo sustentabilidad para nosotros como equipo ha sido fundamental la metodología de trabajo y en ello quiero destacar la colaboración continua frecuente consistente responsable documental y organizada que ha venido realizando el equipo símil con el aporte de la junta de vigilancia la dirección general de agua y corfo vamos realizando avance en relación a los objetivos revisamos los indicadores discutimos acordamos tenemos actas que sean enviadas y oficializada y tenemos un seguimiento y registro de la operación y a petición de nuestro mandante aumentamos las frecuencias de reuniones a dos veces al mes estas y se ponen esta figura porque la figura superior nos muestra cómo nos reuníamos antes la figura de abajo izquierda como nos estamos reuniendo estuve una pequeña reunión y como a lo mejor nos vamos a tener que reunir a futuro al aire libre o siguiendo una mezcla del aire libre y siguiendo por las reuniones en zoom los indicadores de avance la etapa 1 tenemos un modelo validado hasta marzo el 2020 y necesitamos seguir discutiendo con nuestros actores relevantes los escenarios ya hicimos en la etapa dos talleres digamos cinco talleres ejecutados y grabados tres manuales y vídeos de operación y en la etapa 3 estamos organizan 12 talleres y la etapa 4 los tres modelos de sustentabilidad 7 servicio identificado y acuerdo de una conversación de una corporación quiero agradecer en él para finalizar mi representación en verdad a todas las personas que están detrás de este proyecto que son en orden de cordillera mar rodrigo rivero de la primera sección en este hombre de la segunda sección santiago mata de la tercera sección danielle de blasis de putaendo a corfo nuestro ejecutivo pablo díaz dirección general de agua a la pamela garcía y a mauricio lorca muchas gracias por su apoyo el perfil de valparaíso quiero agradecer en especial a kurt new link y a pierina que siempre han estado apoyándonos a esval quiero agradecer es recientemente oscar diera gracias por tu tiempo y sentarte a conversar con el grupo también a la gente de codelco que nos has facilitado los datos de nieve a través de la primera sección y al equipo de ellos y dave y en especial a javier caamaño nuestro ideólogo a roberto fuente nuestro haití la persona detrás de la página web a rodrigo riquelme hizo todo el trabajo inicial de contacto y colaboración quiero dedicarles esta frase a todo el equipo de civil que de alguna forma hemos hecho no hemos levantado con valentía y con un propósito claro que es apoyar la gestión hídrica la cuenca lo con caguas así que con eso me despido y abierta a las preguntas y gracias por su atención mi correo está abajo y la dirección de nuestro centro está también ahí muchas gracias vas a granxa alejandra por la presentación hay varias varias preguntas aparte de algunos comentarios y sobre el nivel de información que se halla manejando obviamente muchos que en el link a poder ver ahí tú javier tamaño en el chat dejo puesto ya el link de la página de la de la plataforma si me que está aún en desarrollo y algunas preguntas bien concretas alejandra una bien específica [Música] entiendo que lo que hace es exactamente metodología encargó un estudio de plan estratégico para esta cuenca la cual considera la actualización de ambos modelos wi-fi el mod demostró tienes pensado que tenemos pensado comparar estas nuevas versiones de la plataforma es una buena pregunta y eso lo hemos estado nosotros discutiendo en las reuniones nosotros que abre ya como dice sam sandoval destripamos el modelo lo entendemos mucho más pero nosotros por por tiempo por marco de tiempo del proyecto estamos trabajando con la versión que nos entregaron en diciembre del 2019 una sería un desafío para el equipo poder incluir pero no está dentro de nuestro marco de proyecto por un tema temporal se habla sobre sí sobre el tema de nieve reciben y dales el examen tal vez aquí es el problema no tienen un moderador que también ha participado en estas cosas es parte de instituciones 'este estrenaban inyectó este proyecto nace antes de que el proyecto empezará como tal nos da la verdad es que el proyecto bien público que corso impulso y apoyo cubre una una sección de lo que nosotros como yusidei de chile con experiencia de california que hicimos en el momento plantear en chile y el modelo completo sea integrar toda la parte nivel los usos de agua agua urbana agua potable rural tiene un modelo mayor y que además de escalable a nivel nacional contar millones y millones ahora que está de nuevo no es un instrumento que desde millones y millón de dólares para poder hacer esto a nivel a nivel nacional que obviamente no depende una institución sino que depende una integración de muchas instituciones como bien sanz nos mostró en su primera la primera presentación de diría este proyecto desde nuestro punto de vista como you say visible es es un piloto a un piloto que puede crecer en términos en términos espaciales en los mismos términos que usas sanos el otro es su presentación que puede ser replicable muchos en muchas cuencas claramente el modelo matemático o los modelos que ya tiene desarrollado una forma ya existen o van a seguir siendo perfeccionado a futuro este lo complejo lo interesante es como el modelo de compartir información de validar la información el que baje un grande nuevo requerimiento futuro yo diría que se fueron los grandes desafíos de este proyecto y fue poner en la mesa de la información que antes si bien estará no estaba puesta en la mesa ya y poder trabajar en base a información común los modelos para ser perfeccionable a futuro la tecnología nos remite en el mejor trata a uno pero como bien se dijo es necesario saber qué vamos a hacer con esa información no es la ciencia detrás no es que nos sigamos dando vuelta con los modelos ampa nos lo dijo antes los científicos van a seguir dándose vuelta con el modelo para reflexionar levantar los coeficientes vamos mejorar lo que cuadra altera etcétera pluralidad esto es para tomar decisiones y una de las decisiones que yo para puerto conexiones que saber la información es válida sirve es perfecta no nunca siempre puede ser perfecto y ojalá podamos integrar cada vez más variables dentro de esta iniciativa los corrientes se alejan de estas iniciativas finitas son proyectos son programas de estado a largo plazo pero lo que ya hemos conseguido es que tenemos agencias de estado la dga lo que sirva prácticamente corfo también estás en una serie de programas que tienen que ver con agua en otros ámbitos se está formando se están formando alianzas entre distintas universidades en nosotros por ejemplo por yosi directv ya estamos en la naturalidad esa grande con la universidad concepción con la universidad católica con la universidad de chile trabajando en cómo poder ir mejorando no esta plataforma sino que muchas más y cómo ir abordando los temas de agua a nivel nacional aprovechando desde luego una experiencia y como escuches no era agua llenar 10 días sino que el ruinas del saldo y abre las más tempranos de calidad de agua aprovechemos los errores que cometió california no los comentamos nosotros a ella ya ya metieron la pata en algunas cosas dijimos que el control de la pata los dólares los dos los pesos podemos pagarlos y eso está mal aquí marisio algo que está haciendo vale que estamos haciendo aquí con respecto a la pregunta que cristian estrada nos envía y es que o sea nosotros no vamos a evaluar ahorita la recarga artificial pero con el equipo de javier y ya le hemos estado generando videos en los cuales mostramos como en la plataforma general y luego cómo operar el modelo es decir estamos tratando dejar todas las cm las guías para que los usuarios después puedan utilizar el modelo y puedan este hacer sus propias modificaciones a aplicaciones ver sus ideas no entonces es también parte de la sustentabilidad que hemos estado trabajando ahí con con alé que es una vez que nosotros ya tengamos el proyecto y que lo cumplamos nuestros objetivos como dejarlo para que no les pase lo que a nosotros nos pasó que es aquí está el modelo y ahora el puedes darle lo yo también quiero adicionar ahí en nuestro en nuestras reuniones de discusión con el proyecto ya hemos nosotros discutió tres escenarios posibles de sustentabilidad y esa sustentabilidad económica y dentro de los servicios que nosotros hemos identificado que sería interesante es seguir modelando seguir estudiando la cuenca y entregar reportes reportes anuales reportes mensuales y el fondo y recogiendo el interés de los usuarios de la cuenca el término de información y de modelación y en eso lo hemos nutrido bastante con los talleres iniciales que hicimos vi azul en el cual escuchamos a los miembros de las juntas de vigilancia para entender un poco en qué ellos estaban interesados en ver escuchar a los usuarios para nosotros ha sido de mucha importancia gracias gracias alejandra por la presentación gracias am por la presentación anterior y por el trabajo que también desde california se ha hecho en este proyecto puntual que les repito la idea nuestra de este webinar en la parte es mostrar lo que se está haciendo el proyecto pero también hacer disponible a toda la comunidad de chile a todos los usuarios a todos los actores que tienen que ver con el agua lo que está disponible en la experiencia de california bueno y ahora para ir cerrando solamente con 81 todas estas excelentes ah a rodrigo a rodrigo rivero el gerente de btr la gente de la primera de la primera sección para que más de hernán algunas palabras finales y me escuchen y si escuchamos gracias muchas gracias por la invitación pero bueno sobre todo gracias a dios y babies a todo el equipo que ha trabajado cada vez en la región en este proyecto azzam sandoval por por venir tan lejos pero de verdad siento porque este este proyecto como se menciona en algún minuto un proyecto que nace común que nos cuesta mucho es muy frecuente ver qué ocurre con nosotros en el aconcagua creo que sobran son los problemas y los conflictos sin embargo hace un tiempo ya estamos empeñados en buscar soluciones comunes para el problema común que tenemos al final tratando de solucionar las cosas solo no nos ha ido tan bien entonces estamos tratando de buscar la forma de solucionar las en conjunto y una de las primeras cosas que surgió como como viable de hacer y que un problema que voy a meter todos los que hacemos gestiones aquí en cualquier lado en la necesidad de contar con información confiable y común sobre la cual mirar y te recuerdo y así salió este proyecto qué amablemente cuerpo financió qué yo si veis como el desafío de hacer y que a los cuales se sumó también con mucho ánimo y ganas a la dga y otros actores más apoyaron títulos mencionarte alejandré de hierro es el gran mérito que tiene este proyecto ahora claramente viene a tratar de solucionar las preguntas que nos hagamos y yo quiero hacer un en pacientes hoy yo creo que este proyecto es un inicio una fecha de término y que si queremos que esto sea una herramienta que nos sirva en el futuro tenemos que ver la manera de que eso ocurra y ocurrir siempre y cuando sea una herramienta que nos sirva entonces en ese sentido es súper relevante que responde a las preguntas que tenemos de parte de los usuarios tenemos que ser capaces plasmar o ser claros en cuáles son esas preguntas [Música] y así puedes construir la vimos que la plataforma apenas fue construida lo primero que hizo fue de poner a disposición la pregunta que nos hacemos todos los días en la mañana cuánta agua borchardt sacado kilos al principio romeros y sólo respondiendo a esa pregunta logramos tener todas las visitas que tú estés la página y la valoración es que hasta el momento hemos conseguido imágenes de la cantidad de otras preguntas que podemos resolver teniendo toda la información de la cuenca en un solo lugar y con la posibilidad de sacarle el nido con el modelo o con la ingeniería que podamos meterle a todos esos datos yo creo que hay un gran pueden ser la caja y tenemos que ver hacerlo crecer y cuánto crees cava de dónde eres exclusivamente de los mismos que hicimos hacer esto que somos los usuarios ciertos los principales necesitados de toda esa información y también el resto de la comunidad de esta información está disponible para todo el mundo y también es importante que la comunidad también tenga acceso a esa información eso nomás quería meter la gracia y también saludos una gracia de escuchar la voz de quienes son los que finalmente utilizan de mayor manera está esta plataforma y con quienes partimos también con todas estas conversaciones de hacer más les diría que cree años atrás que parte de la conversación ante estas estas cosas nos nace en cuanto con spacex a crear nacen como lo menos de un año antes las las reuniones el levantamiento de los libatique así de potenciales soluciones bueno muchas gracias a todos con esto damos damos cierre a este webinar de seminario gracias por la participación de los métodos entonces 100 participantes siguen apareciendo en pantalla mantuvimos la atención o una rotación muy muy muy uniforme usted es el vamos a seguir manteniendo informado de futuras futuras actividades no solamente en el marco de la cuenca sino que además en lo que estamos haciendo en agua intensamente en las próximas semanas hay temas que no solamente van en el manejo de las cuencas sino que también en cómo ser más eficiente en el uso de intermediar cómo lidiar con las sequías de mejor forma también en todas sus perspectivas y les aseguro que california tiene mucha mucha experiencia que vamos a seguir compartiendo con ustedes en distintas series de seminarios con distintos con distintos profesores de la calidad como cosas que ha participado activamente en este proyecto también nos lo empieza a relacionar el doctor fotógrafo que también ha participado intensamente en este proyecto desde california bueno los seguiremos manteniendo al tanto no sólo de esto sino lo que podemos hacer en agua niell a nivel nacional y bueno las próximas que no sepamos tener la suerte que sea en español muchas presentaciones pero bueno ahí buscaremos cómo ir acortando el veto también del idioma por lo pronto también los dejo invitados que estén en el mundo de los alimentos de la industria de los alimentos el agro el jueves tenemos un nuevo webinar que tiene que con los temas de economía circular que también ha estado trabajando más de cerca con el ministerio de agricultura y que bueno también circularán un tema netamente vamos a dedicar hasta el agua está metida dentro la economía se oculta bien no solamente los desechos el reciclaje y los y los desperdicios así que quedan también cordialmente invitado al webinar del jueves que también la información está en nuestra página web y la publicidad y punto gracias a todos y gracias gracias gracias",
      "title": "Webinar UC Davis Chile UCDavis Chile 1 likes 323 views 25 Aug 2020 Revive el Webinar \"Información y modelación en cuencas hidrográficas, experiencia en California y el caso del Aconcagua, Chile\", realizado el 24 y que contó con las presentaciones del Dr. Samuel Sandoval de UC Davis y la Dra. Alejandra Acuña, Agronomy Coordinator de UC Davis Chile. 0 comments muy buenas tardes soy francisco díaz el gerente de socios y de comunicaciones del centro de la universidad de california en davis aquí en chile es un gusto para mí saludarlos y en nombre de la universidad de california del centro del país darle la más cordial bienvenida a todas y todos los que nos acompañan en este webinar donde queremos abordar temas relacionados con el uso y la eficiencia del agua en los sistemas de riego pero también su administración en las cuencas hidrográficas de nuestro país concretamente la temática es la información y la modelación encuadran en cuencas hidrográficas experiencias en california y el caso de el aconcagua en nuestro país moderador de esta actividad va a ser el gerente general de el centro de la universidad de california en chile el doctor mauricio ocaño les los dejó a todos con el que irá presentando a quienes intervienen y también moderará los espacios de pregunta interacción antes de dar la palabra definitivamente a mauricio algunas indicaciones prácticas para poder formular consultas a los expositores ustedes se encuentran en su botonera abajo una sección donde se enseñaran preguntas y respuestas o bien you and i la solamente las letras que hablan de questions and cancer solo en ese espacio se pueden formular las preguntas no está habilitado el chat para interactuar esperamos tener entonces una buena conversación técnica que sea de provecho para todos ustedes muy buenas tardes mauricio caníbales por favor hola buenas tardes bienvenidos a todos es un placer nuevamente poder reunirnos antes en torno al tema al tema del agua y especialmente después de llevar más de más de un año y medio dos años trabajando puntualmente dentro de la cuenca del aconcagua está esta actividad se enmarca entre otras cosas en el proyecto en el proyecto que llevamos desarrollando en la cuenca con la dirección general de agua con él con las juntas de vigilancia y otros actores de la proyección con el apoyo con el apoyo y con que hay que decirlo otras maneras sobre el apoyo desde el punto de vista financiero sino que el apoyo a plaquetas este tipo de iniciativas realmente puedan pueden funcionar desde la corso particularmente la corfo de la dirección regional de valparaíso dentro del marco de este webinar así como otros que hemos estado realizando nuestra idea es poder mostrar a los distintos usuarios al público chileno como california que tiene condiciones muy similares ha estado lidiando con esto y transmitir esa experiencia hacia asia los actores locales me refiero chileno solamente las cuencas esto los movimientos a través de la presentación y bueno para partir este evento es abierto por el director nacional de la dirección acciones de amor aleja del ministerio obras públicas señaló que christie's quien sea dirigir a todos nosotros después de buscar hablará el director regional de corfo de la región de valparaíso acuña así que dejo a ellos la palabra parte de oscar y mauricio hola no tengo acceso al vídeo así que no sé si no que me quieren ver con acceso no sé cómo lo solucionamos no dice no puede iniciar su vídeo por quiero perder ahora lo detuvo vamos a ver en la parte técnica carolina tú puedes ver eso inicial me parece que es gracia [Risas] buenas tardes bueno muchas gracias por la invitación por organizar este seminario que no que es muy importante porque por lo que voy a explicar ahora para todos evidentes que chile es un país que como tantos otros está enfrentando una sequía que ya denominamos como sequía estructural y nuestras proyecciones para el futuro muestran un deterioro mayor en la disponibilidad de agua y para hacer frente a este desafío estamos convencidos que tengan la gestión del recurso e indispensable y para gestionar lo sabemos todo muy bien se necesita más información y más planificación de la que actualmente tenemos se dice con mucha propiedad que lo que no se mide no se gestiona ni se planifica y por tanto el levantar información a nivel de las cuencas el levantar información de las fuentes naturales de agua en cada de las cuencas indispensables para después avanzar un proceso de planificación y este llamado los desafíos que nos hemos propuesto como dirección general de agua para este periodo 2018 2021 está entre los siete desafíos principales el poder aportar también de información y de planificación y en esa línea hemos ido dando algunos avances importantes ustedes conocerán por ejemplo que la dga ha actualizado el balance internacional que eran muy antiguos está prácticamente completo y nos falta una parte de la zona austral continental y la isla de pascua pero resto el país ya está completo ese balance hemos terminado también la dga un estudio demanda actual y proyectada esto esto es incluso anterior a mi propia gestión porque ambos son proyectos que se comenzaron a iniciar en la gestión pasada y nosotros nos ha tocado tomar la posta lo cual habla de que incluso aún cuando los buenos cambien todos coincidimos en la importancia de generar una mejor información respecto al recurso hídrico también hemos dado un paso muy importante a partir del año pasado en términos de medición de tracción es efectiva a lo largo del país hemos comenzado un plan muy ambicioso con el monitoreo de pozos para la extracción de agua subterránea esto ya se inició llevamos más de 132 sistemas de aprovechamiento hidrológico en los cuales este proceso ya se ha iniciado eso incluye la casi totalidad de las 79 áreas donde hay prohibición para entregar importante donde mayor y de mayor importancia la medición y en los próximos meses vamos a empezar o vamos a comenzar con la medición en todas las bocatomas del país esto sin duda que es un cambio muy importante es un acceso a una información muy relevante que hoy no tenemos y en materia de planificación y modelación hemos también iniciado ya a partir de allí basado un trabajo muy ordenado y muy planificado justamente para poder mejorar la información y la planificación el asiento 1 cuenca del país y comenzamos con las 20 cuencas donde hay más estrés hídrico y dentro de los meses de este año y comienzo el próximo año llevamos contar con los 20 primeros planes de gestión estratégica para las 20 cuencas más extensa del país y después vamos a ir avanzando hasta poder completar el acento en cuenca del país en un plazo probablemente de 8 o 10 años en este contexto sin duda que el trabajo que está abordando la universidad de davis es muy relevante con su proyecto central de información y modelación ideológica que se desarrolla en la cuenca del aconcagua un trabajo que hemos hecho en conjunto tanto el equipo de jucilei dish como el equipo de la elegida y la junta de vigilancia del río aconcagua y aquí destacar la importancia que le asignamos a este tipo de trabajo popular colaborativo donde distintas inclusiones ponen a disposición de los usuarios el conocimiento para poder concluir con un plan una modelación que sea relevante para la toma de decisiones los planes que como decía hemos iniciado y también en esa línea de proyectos y davis no son un planes para la academia no son estudios para la academia principalmente sino que está más bien orientado hacia la gestión de red a la toma de decisiones en la toma de decisiones que puede hacer la institución el estado que tiene que invertir en infraestructura hídrica por ejemplo pero también muy importante en los mismos usuarios que tienen que tomar decisiones respecto a inversiones privadas que tengan que hacer y que dependan del agua para ellos también es muy importante por eso que es una de nuestras aspiraciones que todo estos planes que estamos haciendo en la ciudad estén disponibles para los distintos usuarios a través de una plataforma a la cual se puede acceder es de internet básicamente una plataforma online donde esté disponible la información que se generan en estos modelos y esté disponible ciertos tipos de modelación es para que los usuarios puedan ir haciendo si estas simulaciones respecto a las materias que más le interesa y hay que este proyecto de lucidez tenga no sólo el valor de avanzar en la planificación sino también el valor de poner a disposición de los usuarios esta moderación que en la base de esta planificación de la cuenca y esto que estamos comenzando ahora con usb en nuestra aspiración a hacerlo para la totalidad de los planes que se generen en la dga de ahí entonces que sea no sólo extraordinariamente importante el trabajo y si davis que sea también muy importante y relevante poder conocer la experiencia y poder discutirlas en este web seminal así que los felicito le dará escuela posibilidad al mes dejado dar estas palabras iniciales y les deseo el máximo éxito lo que viene en este webinar gracias muchas gracias aunque seguimos con fernando acuña director regional d de la corfo reacción de valparaíso gracia mauricio un saludo a ustedes gracias por llevar adelante esto independiente del momento que estamos viviendo igual seguir con estos proyectos e igual seguir dándole nos parece importante como corfo salud oscar buscar gracias por la participación y por el compromiso de la dga da en este importante proyecto y también bueno a los actores es cierto que son los a los dirigentes que están presentes de las tres secciones de tres de las cuatro secciones del vídeo con caguas y que un gran saludo y un saludo a los 100 llegamos a 100 a los 100 conectados hoy día y estamos demostrando que y por eso le decía felicitaciones porque no obstante lo que está sucediendo y todo lo complicado que estamos igual seguir adelante con estos importantes proyectos recordarle que si usted ve la riva mi cabeza siempre está proyecto corfo este es un proyecto que fue un bien público bueno nosotros como corfo siempre estábamos preocupados de que los bienes públicos tan orientados a levantar un cierto un dolor y poder solucionar un tema es un tema de coordinación como tenemos otros programas estratégicos y los bienes públicos también de corfo este como bien público la idea es poder aportar y así que feliz de que se esté llevando adelante está con los financiamientos de la corfo yo creo que lo importante que son el tema del recurso hídrico el otro día tuve en el lanzamiento del pp y de petorca y recordaba mi experiencia en argumentos con los años que viene y como en la gestión del poco recurso hídrico que tenía y allá en la zona una épica les permitió ir avanzando y tomándose el desierto solamente por la gestión hídrica y ahora son plantaciones grandes de cítricos y de otros de de aceituna y otras cosas que ya en el cerca pica en el desierto entonces aquí hay un tema que siempre hablamos el tema del recurso hídrico yo creo que aquí tenemos a paulo que me ha explicado parte de este proyecto es el tomar los días que el ejecutivo de corfo que a mí me parece súper interesante de memoria común como ingeniero electrónico y como magíster en gestión en la mezcla de las dos cosas la tecnología cierto con el tema de gestión entonces usando tecnología para la gestión hídrica yo creo que es un recurso escaso sabemos que no sabe mejor que yo así que hacer gestión de esto es súper importante yo creo que vamos a conocerlo avance en esta plataforma lo avance con agua y también conocer si esto el caso de california yo creo que es muy importante que nos vamos documentando y vamos viendo como avanzando que nos interesan como corfo que estos proyectos que se financian cierto también vayan avanzando y vayan pasando como un trabajo conjunto cierto como también se llama mauricio conocí a oscar este es un trabajo de todo ciento un trabajo de coordinación y que en conjunto sacamos adelante así que feliz feliz de estar y de tener esta convocatoria de tener este interés estamos empeñados y ha visto los avances y que parece muy interesante cómo han ido avanzando y esto también es importante un mensaje la idea es que un objetivo de estos proyectos es también darle la sustentabilidad o sea hay un trabajo yo sé que usted está trabajando en eso de como usted de que esto se proyecte en el tiempo y que esta coordinación se transforme en algo que sea permanente en el tiempo así que eso nos interesa también de sobremanera bar que esta coordinación siga hacia adelante así que felicitaciones por esta actividad algo digo con estos 102 conectados y que seguimos adelante con estas actividades ahora vamos a echar de menos café cierto lo que me disguste pero pero estamos saliendo adelante ya y sobre todo el contacto la gente pero importante verlo velado bien y que no obstante esto como digo insisto se sigue adelante nuestros proyectos nos interesa que tengan éxito como corfo y no perder de vista siempre estar atento a eso de la proyección y la sustentabilidad así que un abrazo a todos muchas gracias por la invitación gracias gracias por tu palabra es muy cierto lo que dice de hecho el botón incidencia siento estamos de las cosas que el cob y nos ha obligado a hacer conectarnos cada vez más en forma electrónica cosas que antes teníamos que tener café teníamos que tener las galletas pero eso también nos limitaba el acceso el acceso a tener panelistas a cuadrar agendas de panelistas que no están necesariamente en chile y además de poder ampliar esta convocatoria no solamente a la zona del proyecto es por eso que nosotros en esta actividad la siguiente se organizó inicialmente pensando en los involucrados del proyecto planteamos a todos chiles de hecho hay muchos conectados de otras puntas de vigilancia de otras asociaciones u otros usuarios de agua a lo largo a lo largo de chile y es también nos permite tener varios seminarios distintas temáticas puestas a punto de hecho las 12 del día venía saliendo tenía muchos seminarios de agua pero en temas en temas de calidad de agua los lagos con los lava por unos patagónicos con la experiencia en ley tajos ley tajo center que está también alojado en yushu davis con algunas iniciativas que tenemos acá en chile en la región de la región de los lagos la región de los ríos y más al sur con los lagos patagónicos bueno ahora dejo con ustedes la presentación del doctor es de samuel sandoval tan sano como lo llevamos siempre sabe especialista en recursos hídricos de 10 y davis es de responsable de programas de investigación en gestión de agua dentro la universidad era desarrollado con otros métodos para mejorar la gestión del agua en el uso humano en el uso en el uso de la agricultura zuma no solamente la potable además siempre poniendo en la balanza cómo se hace a nivel internacional los temas ambientales sanz ha realizado su investigación principalmente en el estado de california y en las cuencas transfronterizas del río grano recientemente ha evaluado la cantidad de agua que se puede ahorrar para disminuir la demanda de agua en la instrucción de agua salina en la costa central de california donde hay un tema del agua que está por la vida y recientemente ha trabajado un estudio para determinar caudales ecológicos en todo el estado de california también ha publicado un estudio sobre el cambio temporal y espacial de eficiencia en los sistemas de riego en el estado de california entre otras cosas porque con un examen espeso y una gran ventaja que si bien él está en california pero desde orígenes latinos replicable español ya está hablando chileno últimamente sí que se está logrando muy fuerte también dentro de este proyecto no solamente su experiencia casi involucrado directamente el frito gracias antes que nada bienvenidos a todos y lo que voy a hacer es que [Música] ahora puede compartir la pantalla y antes de empezar con todo esto algo que me gustaría mencionarles ustedes están viendo esta pantalla en la parte de abajo debe de salir una una barra de herramientas y en esa barrera de herramientas debe de venir algo que dice van eyck y ya entonces con esto sin sale pamela en la parte de abajo debe de venir las herramientas debe de venir una que diga así como juanes en respuesta a preguntas y respuestas entonces aquí por favor que es como si hubieran 22 chats en ese si tienen alguna pregunta ayman del lado y sé que yo voy a ir filtrando las preguntas o al final o si son más un poco más sencillas pues lo haré en el momento es lo primero entonces también lo que dice morís y es súper importante antes me parece que la distancia estaba de un panelista a un auditorio ahora realmente la distancia está de tu monitora a mi monitor estamos pues platicando no los dos eso es importante la tercera es que este trabajo que les voy a prevé presentar ha sido también en colaboración con el canal y con esta alejandra cugno con javier con roberto se ha armado muy buen equipo y con el conocida ibis chile y bueno pues la idea es seguir compartiendo un poco más de información por ejemplo maría como pareció que el leer que este seminario va a quedar disponible en una url y es correcto y también ya les enviamos las copias de la presentación entonces este sí decirles vamos a enviar tanto el vídeo como la presentación bueno vamos a ir avanzando un poquito aquí ok primero les voy a presentar un poco acerca de cuáles son las expectativas de este seminario y vamos a hablar de gestión del agua un poco de gobernanza modelos y luego ya nos vamos en el caso de estudio y hablaré más acerca del river después salí a hablar acerca del río aconcagua y algunas recomendaciones lo que ustedes ven aquí son gestos de trabajo es texto están viendo aquí este es el río bravo esta será del russian river y este es del estado de california y si se dan cuenta o sea independientemente de cómo como sucede esto pues se ven igual no siempre es la gente alrededor de una mesa hablando acerca de problemas relacionados al agua y miren en este momento no me mire tanto a legislar bueno en el caso del il rivers y hablar un poco de legislaciones pero voy a tratar de mantenerla en un contexto general para que así podamos hacer un poco más de correlación o relación entre en california al estar un poco acerca de gestión del agua y gestión del agua no solamente se refiere a la parte de herramientas que esto es algo de lo que estamos hablando ahorita o en la parte de instrumentos económicos son medidas técnicas no vamos a poner un poco más del concreto o hacer la parte más de infraestructura pero también es acerca de cómo se dan las tomas de decisiones el contexto físico y ambiental y el son no solamente manejar el agua sino los recursos que dependen de ella y bueno pues tratar de relacionar algunos proyectos de california in chile así en alguna discusión percibo que hay uno que les quiere decir es que nos vamos a ir a un nivel un poquito más más general este es el mapa esta es la guía de los temas que iré tocando y ya conforme los vaya tocando bueno pues iremos a ir viendo cómo cómo se va desarrollando la presentación primero les hablaré acerca de gestión del agua básicamente hacemos la gestión del agua porque el agua no la tenemos en la cantidad y calidad adecuada en el momento en el que la necesitamos y entonces existe esta disciplina que se llama y ese manejo del agua o gestión del agua en la cual utilizamos métodos o técnicas para re distribuir el agua en tiempo y espacio incluyendo el medio ambiente y con esta inversión visión de sustentabilidad que es para hoy en el futuro esto que ustedes ven aquí el mapa que ven ustedes aquí básicamente en en estas áreas azul azul marino y azul claro el que el 90% de la precipitación en california y solamente acá y el 10% en la además este 90% de precipitación que hay en el 40 por ciento del área entonces aquí el problema que tenemos es que bueno primero solamente llueve en invierno o básicamente en invierno y se necesita y básicamente en esta en esta zona en esta parte norte las demandas pues si uno utiliza el agua en todo el a lo largo de todo el año y para la agricultura pues se utiliza más en la época del verano y las demandas agrícolas son básicamente aquí en el valle central en el valle de imperial en el valle de salinas pájaro y toda la santa santamaría santa margarita bueno eso es cómo se utiliza entonces tenemos una desconexión en tiempo es decir 9 en una época y necesitamos el agua en otra época del año entonces pues para eso lo que hemos generado son este tipo de almacenamientos todos los triangulitos que ustedes ven aquí es una serie de almacenamiento tienen distintos colores porque son operados o son manejados por distintas instituciones federal estatal y local entonces cómo movemos el agua en tiempo mediante presas y acuíferos así es como almacenamos el agua y después pues vendría la parte espacial que que hay en ciertos lugares y las necesitamos en otros lugares y para eso bueno se han desarrollado acueductos canales tuberías no en este caso es aquí la parte más importante es que se hace mucho trasvase de agua se mueve mucha agua de un de una parte a otra es decir del río sacramento se puede mover hasta la la otra esquina del estado y así no en él aunque en teoría bueno pues esto se ve muy muy bien yo les puedo decir que no ha dado muy buen resultado de estas políticas desde los 1920 1940 y después ha sido más que hacer un tema no en una gestión de demanda de agua ha sido una gestión de abastecimiento de agua ya qué me refiero que si me falta un problema no es que vaya a crecer y que necesita más agua el problema es donde me van a traer el agua la relación de esto es que si ustedes tienen algún familiar o alguna familia alguna persona que algún amigo que lleva dinero entonces la solución o lo que aquí ustedes están viendo se incrementarle el monto del adeudo no más que enseñarle a esta persona a vivir con con sus propios recursos financieros es exactamente lo mismo aquí más que cada cuenca haya intentado vivir con sus recursos pues le ido a pedir prestado a los a los vecinos y esto esto ha generado que les digo desde esta época desde 1920 pues hasta la fecha la gente siga sobreexplotando todos estos proyectos que ustedes vieron aquí fueron generados porque existía una una sobreexplotación de agua en esta zona del acuífero entonces primero se les trajo agua superficial se les ha traído más agua superficial a los agricultores y cómo se dan cuenta aquí el suelo antes estaba en 1925 a esta altura esto será en 1955 1977 y ahorita está eso más hundido porque segundo porque han sobreexplotado acuífero de abajo se a pesar de que se le traiga agua la gente sigue sobre explotando la cosa no ha sido la solución los trasvases iniciar algo me queda súper claro es que cuando alguien debe la la estrategia no es e incrementar la línea de crédito la estrategia es ver cómo puede vivir con sus propios recursos financieros y esto es lo mismo en agua extraer más agua es ver cómo se puede ajustar un nuevo con los recursos que no tienen bueno esto es por ejemplo todavía seguimos con sobreexplotación en algunas de estas zonas el suelo se sigue esté asentando alrededor de sencillos viendo alrededor de uno diez quince centímetros al año es increíble y bueno pues ha pasado más que los descensos de la de la napa es que cuando se saca el agua del subsuelo el suelo se va contrayendo en las capas de arcilla se van contrayendo y por eso se hunde el suelo entonces es una lana para ahorita ya debe de estar allí alrededor de los 400 a 600 metros de profundidad cuando antes estaba el nivel del suelo ambiente relación con el río esta sería una clasificación de donde tenemos la alteración básicamente la alteración ha llegado a todas las partes del río bueno esto es básicamente que lo que les dije son unos 150 años de historia de california en cuanto a gestión del agua ahora en gestión del agua en lo que hacemos es ver la parte del medio bueno el común el ciclo del agua de forma natural y después ver cómo cuáles son los procesos para manejar esta agua cristian esa pregunta lo voy a responder un poquito más tarde es un poquito más éste especifica bueno lo que ustedes ven aquí es como son los procesos naturales es decir un río responde de minutos horas hasta casi años es decir desde que llueve y como el agua se va moviendo en los ríos como llegan tiene esa variación y tiene una variación espacial desde casi una hectárea hasta los kilómetros cuadrados no miles de kilómetros cuadrados esto será el escurrimiento esto será la parte de aguas subterráneas es esperar la parte de cobertura del suelo esto es como que la parte este natural si lo hubiéramos con los procesos que nosotros utilizamos en el caso de mitigación de inundaciones o manejo de inundaciones esto viene de la parte bueno la operación la hacemos en horas minutos a días y bueno nosotros hacemos análisis en décadas para ver cuáles son las lluvias de retorno en cuanto a operación la operación la hacemos de días y semanas la operación aunque nos cuando nosotros queramos hacer una operación de canales presas es más o menos de ese orden y bueno estamos hablando de microcuencas al tamaño de un tributario más o menos y en la operación lo que decidimos es necesitamos generar estos manuales de operación en instrucciones detalladas y la operación día a día eso es diferente a la parte de planeación en planeación nosotros estamos hablando de semanas fabricadas y mamá pero en general estamos hablando más de temporadas años la planeación está más de este lado y el tipo de decisiones que hacemos son son reglamentos es como que reglas de quién va a usar agua primero después en caso de sequía en caso de excedente estas son políticas de mediano a largo plazo y bueno esto nos ayuda para definir ciertas inversiones aquí lo que me gustaría es que tanto la página web que están en la conagua eso es un poco más para operar y tiene cierto ciertos beneficios lo que estamos haciendo con el modelo de planeación y todo bien es cierto objetivo que sería el mediano a largo plazo al otro es un poco al corto y en el que ustedes tengan muy muy claro eso porque en general luego están uno confunde de que a bueno es una operación está diciendo en planeación la planeación es un poco pues está más grandes gana [Música] bueno diego ahorita también tienen que responder esa pregunta acerca de los de la modelación si tiene razón de hecho todos los datos de entrada tienen cierto por 200 problemas o cierta incertidumbre esa la podemos ir viendo pero sobre todo a nivel mensual y anual ahí es cuando se cuando se hace todos los balances los los water bots allí no se dan cuenta que también lo que está en mal estado bueno esto sería para la parte agrícola ambiental y energía pero aquí lo que quiero tienes que es súper claro es que operación y planeación van de la mano pero no se traslapan mucho y en general pueden ser dos dos temas distintos uno hace la planeación y después ve como uno hacer los manuales para hacer la operación bueno estaremos aquí en manejo de las cuencas esto es lo que está pasando ahorita en el aconcagua y esto pasa en todas las cuencas es decir primero se hace la medición de datos y después se hará el proceso de generar las bases de datos y hacer guardar todos esos esos datos el análisis que es con los modelos que hemos estado trabajando de nube escurrimiento planeación modelos hidráulicos después de eso ya viene la toma de decisiones y después de la toma de decisiones viene la implementación y nuevamente ahí nos vamos al monitoreo y luego los datos análisis y sistematización esto usualmente este proceso es un proceso que no tiene nada que ver con la naturaleza es un proceso de la administración usualmente se administra en los en la duración de las administraciones es decir si es cada cuatro años cuando en todos estos procesos se hacen cada cuatro años o cada cinco años y aquí lo que es súper importante es que bueno pues nosotros o el equipo de davis que nosotros hemos estado trabajando en esta parte de medición bueno los usuarios han estado en la medición nosotros en el procesamiento y análisis y esta parte de la toma de decisiones es una de dos o se dan desde un punto de vista reglamentario o sea que existe una ley dice que hay que hacer algo o se dan desde un punto de vista de incentivos cuando la gente se da cuenta que trabajando en conjunto pueden tener más o mejores beneficios que que trabajarán de forma distinta no gracias aquí es súper importante mencionar que en el tiempo de este proyecto pues es de vida relativamente corto comparado con lo que usualmente se da en estos procesos de gestión de la cuenta no les voy a hablar un poquito acerca de gobernanza y espero dentro de muy poco ya cambiarle al en river este es el estado de california no y lo que nosotros necesitamos es vamos a hacer una decisión y estamos tomar una decisión este es el proceso de decisión o sea existe una ley o existe algún reglamento o algún incentivo en el cual en alguna en alguna fecha vamos a tomar una decisión usualmente considera los usuarios y vende diferentes alternativas y les digo al final es una decisión o un reglamento o un acuerdo o vamos a invertir dinero y aquí lo que viene es que tenemos los tomadores de decisiones y estos tomadores de decisiones usualmente necesitan información tenemos a los científicos a los ingenieros y los ingenieros bueno pues tratarán de proveer esta información a los tomadores de decisión los científicos la verdad es que nosotros nos la pasamos pensando en nuestros modelos y cómo hacer números arriba y abajo pero la verdad es que los tomadores de decisiones aparte de los modelos bueno están viendo cuánto les cuesta y cuál es el los votantes en el sector al que ello representa cuándo van a ser las próximas elecciones y cuál es el el tiempo no solamente el tiempo del proyecto pero los tiempos electorales y así no todo esto que les estoy diciendo que son los usuarios las distintas leyes y las instituciones que que hay participan en esta toma de decisiones todo eso se llama gobernanza del agua o sea esa descripción del proceso de la gente que participa y las instituciones es la gobernando y todo esto está dentro de un contexto social político y ambiental es decir no es lo mismo las piezas compartimos una misma un contexto físico y ambiental entre chile-california pero el contexto social y económico político son distintas y bueno aquí que sale lo último que les voy a hablar de aquí es acerca de las instituciones cada una de ellas tiene un rol y una responsabilidad es decir algunas son agencias que abastecen el agua una institución gubernamental financiera de ciencia o una organización de usuarios y sus responsabilidades pueden ser designación operación planeación pueden ser reguladores pueden ser este su responsabilidad puede ser financiar proveer irrigación o la transferencia de científicos y conocimiento no el problema es que como se darán cuentas por ejemplo aquí el vídeo reclamation no está en la parte alta de la cuenta binacional es una agencia que hace abastecimiento de agua y solamente se designa a asignación operación y planeación pero no hace ni regulación de financiamiento ni irrigación hay otros que harán irrigación y habrá otros que harán esta regulación lo que les quiero decir es que las responsabilidades y los roles se fragmentan y el y entonces el problema de que está esto es que yo la próxima bala la mano derecha le tiene que pedir permiso a la mano izquierda y eso es por a veces por los cuales la gestión es un poco más tardada y esto es esto es un ejemplo de alejandra cuñada le ha hecho estos estudios donde por ejemplo para la explotación de recursos hídricos se tiene la dga la de hojas el indap y la de hojancha y cada uno tienes ciertos tipos de actividades para hacer explotación o abuso de los recursos hídricos les digo es esto es común bueno hay que hacer e involucrar los usuarios puede ser usual usualmente hay dos formas de hacerlo una desde el gobierno hacia los usuarios que es top down o un x de los usuarios y que le presenten sus propuestas a la parte gubernamental que se llama botón en para estructurar el proyecto desde estructura centralizada descentralizada viene déjenme hablarles de la cuenca de gilbert en los últimos 10 minutos esta es una cuenta que está en california está aquí en esta esquinita de todo california está en esta esquina y esta es una cuenta que va que fluye del sur al norte ok esta cuenca que le estoy hablando es esta cuenta de aquí es el y se le llama fork porque tiene como si fuera un tenedor tiene el software el mid of work y el north fork ya tiene tres tres ramas principales como cada rama no le querían llamar distinto entonces tienes el show del miedo y el north fork vale aquí sea bueno sea en california se ha cultivado media marihuana cannabis desde 1795 se legalizó su uso medicinal en el 96 y su uso recreacional en el 2016 a la hora de legalizar el uso represión también se hizo lado el cultivo no se estima que por ejemplo web en el 2010 el 80 por ciento de la producción de marihuana que se consume en los estados unidos venía de esta zona que es donde el river que estamos hablando este de aquí es donde ven todos estos puntos de aquí y aquí es donde está el river es una industria de 10 a 15 millones de 15.000 en millones de dólares para que ustedes tengan una una proporción de toda la industria agrícola son 30 billones y ésta les le va a echar encima 15 más pues es la mitad de la agricultura en el valor económico de la agricultura en california en todos estos usuarios que ustedes ven aquí siempre han existido desde estos desde 1975 había muchos de estos agricultores ya aquí lo que quiere hacer ahorita la autoridad es darles un permiso para que puedan extraer agua de forma legal no es que no no extrajeran a guantes y si lo hacían por acción de forma ilegal este entonces el contexto de lo que les voy a platicar es como generar una la toma de decisiones o el proceso es necesita y vamos a ver a quién le damos un derecho de agua y bajo qué condiciones lo que está es la toma de decisiones entonces nosotros les estamos ayudando a construir los modelos y toda la información para que los tomadores de decisiones hagan esa decisión aquí se ve el river está con la parte alta ustedes se dan cuenta cómo esta causa vemos muy chico esté a salvo no los tributarios y bueno pues el agua bajando el river está encañonado están 50 este será un poco más abajo se darán cuenta que por ejemplo estas épocas de central baja poca agua pero el agua puede llegar hasta estos niveles y después bueno sobrepasar está dentro de un sistema el boscoso y todo esto es hombre le ayuda a los sobre todo a los peces a los salmones a vivir bien ahora estamos en un poco en la parte más baja y normalmente sigue viendo este por algunos ya tenemos algunos bancos pulsan grifos ok fernández carlos esas preguntas responder un poquito después estoy pidiendo todas las preguntas esto ya es la parte más baja y aquí es cuando hay más tributarios bajando esta ya es nuevamente ya en la parte más baja y todo esto es para migración migración de salmones aquí lo que se está haciendo es proteger media mente cuando les estaba hablando acerca de todos estos usuarios que quieren estimar un derecho de agua pero están solicitando un derecho de agua el gobierno lo que tiene que hacer o lo que está haciendo es decidir cuánta agua tiene que dejar en el río para proteger al medio ambiente y el agua que sea beneficiar para el medio ambiente la que está por encima de ese volumen entonces se le puede asignar a los usuarios pues eso es lo que está haciendo por eso es que estamos haciendo toda esta caracterización esta es en la parte más baja aquí se ven esta es una producción e índoles un green house un pequeño vivero para pues cultivaron la siembra de marihuana y bueno pues aquí se ve que puede haber tanto autor que son estas plantaciones afuera como la de indoor que están entonces hay que determinar estos caudales ambientales caudales ecológicos con base en eso después ver cuánta agua se le puede dar a los usuarios para eso estamos desarrollando un sistema regional para un método regional para determinar caudales ecológicos y esto lo estamos haciendo de forma de guías no qué es lo que estamos haciendo pues básicamente estamos primero esta parte de aquí que será la parte ideológica no estamos construyendo modelos de precipitación y con variables atmosféricas modelos de hugh escurrimiento y agua subterránea después en la parte de medioambiental lo que estamos haciendo es haciendo una clasificación geomorfológica es decir como se ve el río cuál es la forma más fácil de decirles esto es que ustedes se pusieron unos goles y mete en la cabeza al río y cómo se vería el río por abajo o cuando lo vimos seco no cómo es cuál es la la topografía no en cómo hacen esto hacer modelación hidráulica y ver cuál es la respuesta de los en este caso de los salmones a la cantidad de agua y a la forma del río y luego la tercera parte que es la estimar las demandas y estrategias de planeación y todo esto lo estamos haciendo en este modelo de disponibilidad para el southport con todos estos proyectos y estamos tratando bueno estamos construir una interfase para los usuarios así es como se ve la hidrología natural en california de esta tecnología natural podemos encontrar nueve regímenes de flujo naturales es decir nueve formas en las cuales el río escurre desde la parte aníbal la parte de lluvia y luego la mezcla entre lluvia y nieve ríos efímeros así se ve esta zona este es un régimen de que tiene lluvias al principio y luego tiene el derretimiento aníbal en esta parte son ríos de este río azul a sólo un poco más oscuro y a todos ellos les hemos encontrado ciertas en ciertas épocas hemos encontrado eventos o características que son beneficia les para el medio ambiente es decir un caudal base en la época de fijación caudal más en la época de lluvias la transición entre caudales altos y caudales bajo los estos escurrimientos que ayudan a mover sedimentos estas primeras lluvias que ayudan a mover la calidad del agua todo esto con estos con la caracterización de esto se puede generar un este régimen medioambiental se puede determinar el caudal medioambiental el caudal ecológico y bueno pues básicamente todas estas métricas la relación se dirige estimado a cada 200 metros en todos los ríos de california todos los ríos de california tienen esto esto es algo que lo acabamos de hacer lo hemos hecho como en cuatro o cinco años no están tan lejos de hacer algo así he intentado en dos o tres ocasiones trabajar en proyectos para hacer la clasificación de ríos y luego hacer estas métricas no están no estamos tan lejos en fin [Música] con claudio con qué criterios técnicos se toman la acción de cuánta agua necesaria dejar en los ríos de nuestras fuentes y luego explicar ahorita miren lo que vamos a hacer sobre todo parece que esta parte es quién es esto solamente si ustedes se dan cuenta esto de aquí es la pura parte de cantidad de agua ok no solamente se necesita cantidad pero se necesita tener buen cauce y como el cauce y la cantidad van a ayudar a responder al hablarles del medio ambiente para responder a la pregunta de claudio tenemos ciertas curvas de preferencia en las cuales vemos cómo responden los peces o no sería muy bien pero sería muy mal dependiendo a la velocidad o la profundidad del próximo los con eso lo que se puede hacer es ver de forma espacial en estos lugares rojitos o amarillos donde se tiene mejor y mejoramiento para los peces que en otros lugares esto lo hemos hecho mediante clasificación es decir fuimos a los ríos y medimos hicimos secciones más ver sales y después clasificamos los tipos de ríos entonces tenemos en este en este río tenemos siete clases de forma de río jerte geomorfología y a cada una de ellas la vamos a hacer una extra quita finca mediana grande grande osa el tamaño del río lo vamos a escalar y vamos a correr en modelos hidrológicos para ver cómo responden los los los peces los criterios técnicos es que nosotros le damos a los tomadores de decisiones una curva de respuesta y el tomador de decisiones dirá bueno si quiero tener una respuesta muy muy buena esta es la cantidad que tengo que dejar y esto es lo que queda disponible para los usuarios porque los dejo - y ellos son los que van a tomar la decisión es importante decirles que los tomadores de decisiones les gusta tomar decisiones si no les dicen que hacer se enojan mucho entonces nosotros les explicamos cuál sería la respuesta que los tomadores de acciones deben de hacerse responsables de las decisiones que toman básicamente este es el sistema que estamos utilizando aquí estamos haciendo lo toma de datos de precipitación a temperatura caudales evapotranspiración estamos haciendo todo el procesamiento y almacenamiento de esa información el análisis que le dije con les dije con los modelos la toma de decisiones y la implementación y básicamente es lo que les digo aquí el proceso de toma decisiones es que el 2016 se aprobó la el uso recreacional o para adultos y se aprobó también la cultivo y debido a eso entonces se tiene que ahora te buscar la protección del medio ambiente y al final la toma de decisiones es cuánta agua es elevada aquí la alternativa es que en épocas de lluvia se va a permitir lo están pensando permitir de almacenamiento micro almacenamiento pequeños points tranquilas pequeños este y reservorios que se puede almacenar el agua a tanques y ya después en la época de estiaje donde no llueve solamente utilizar agua de los tanques no no no sacar nada de agua de los ríos esa esa es una de las opciones tenemos los tomadores de decisiones stewart visores control board básicamente nosotros que es el grupo de davis les yayi y utah state y bueno pues todo lo que hemos estado haciendo el trabajo esto lo tenemos que terminar para el año que entra en 2021 en él [Música] estoy en 32 minutos quizás está es la parte más importante en la gente no importa qué tanto sabes a la gente la gente quiere saber qué tanto te importa los huincas que estás trabajando entonces bueno pues hasta lo dejaría muchas muchas gracias tengo por aquí varias preguntas él [Música] aunque criterios técnicos se toman la decisión de cuánta agua necesaria dejar en los ríos los criterios técnicos de lo que tengo la respuesta y los tomadores de decisiones ven aquí cuál es la respuesta que quieren tener en el río en chile tenemos un código de agua desde 1981 basado en condiciones solo en consideraciones jurídicas desde julio sin tomar en cuenta la observación de la naturaleza de las necesidades reales de riesgo los derechos fueron dados a perpetuidad y también aquí super triste y con la sequía existen derechos sobre agua que físicamente ya no existe también aquí es sobre concesionamiento políticamente hablando es muy complejo hacer las reformas al código hablar de dolor de derogarlo es impronunciable los dueños de los derechos alegan que si el estado se los quiere expropiar debe pagarlos ángel muy complejo no sé si usted tiene alguna idea si tú tienes alguna idea de que suponga una solución a esta problemática aquí lo que se necesita hacer es un poco más de conciliación lo que te decía es que o sea 'una tienes tú tienes dos herramientas básicamente un es el martillo y la otra es una zanahoria d las leyes es el martillo las leyes en inglés le llaman este es el es la vara con la que te pegan y el carro es la zanahoria son los incentivos entonces existe incentivos para que puedan trabajar juntos y puedan y eso es básicamente y revisarlo qué tipo de cultivo revisar cuál va a ser el abastecimiento durante sequías cómo se va a distribuirla en la falta de agua en sequías eso puede ser incentivos pero en general siempre se hace de los dos lados hay que poner error sanabria se enfrente también atrás es el estado en el movimiento flow que es maría angélica elemental flower que señala es equivalente al caudal ambiental que consiste que considera la evaluación ambiental de un proyecto si es correcto que tiene de forma en que tiene un fundamento más ecosistémico también eso es correcto ok mira te voy a explicar en muy rápidos en el fundamento legal que tenemos existen en california no existe una ley en chile o en otros países sino lo que existe son muchos casos que fueron ligados en la corte y como el caso pasó o se quitó a ese se encienda precedente entonces lo que tenemos es una serie de casos que hay que leer para ver cómo se asigna el agua uno de los casos que una de las reglas es que el uso para beneficio público es más importante o está por encima del uso para beneficio de privados eso fue un pleito legal y se gana si entonces lo que sucede es que el luso medioambiental está el preservar al medio ambiente está en una prioridad más alta que el lujo para particulares en este momento en particular quiere obtener un derecho de agua para evitar lo que tú dices que ahora te lo voy a quitar porque quiero proteger el medio ambiente primero estamos estimando el uso medioambiental para evitar eso ok es un criterio de lo lógico y sí que es un criterio hidrológico y que al ser obligatorio a veces se tienen que se piden por ejemplo tres metros de agua en un caudal ecológico de la dga es varias magnitudes mayores del caudal solicitado y uniforme para cualquier tramo así no se tiene se necesita hacer una variabilidad lo que les digo y si hay algo aquí que también quiero quedar súper claro es que la experiencia en california en caudales ecológicos es un espejo en el en el sur los nueve los nueve regímenes de flujo que hemos encontrado en california muy probablemente sean muy parecidos o los mismos en en chile eso me quedó súper claro que se necesita variabilidad temporal en los los reservorios perjudican la circulación de los carbones de los alemanes y si está el reservorio en atravesado en el cauce sí porque evita la conectividad y sin embargo si haces empresas que se llama offspring hacen en las laderas de estos tanques en las laderas puedes sacar agua del cauce cuando hay mucha agua y la puedes guardar ahí esta es una de las soluciones que hemos visto estas soluciones son lo que les llamaban soluciones que no son este son distribuir o sea son soluciones son prácticas distribuidas cómo han influido a la de las demandas civiles en tribunales para proteger a los caudales ecológicos bueno esto fue básicamente un pleito que se le ganó a los ángeles los ángeles traía agua de mono lake en las organismos medioambientales lo demandaron 18 años después ganaron y fue así cómo han influido estas demandas civiles pero lo que les quiero dejar es que no es uno u otro si puede haber beneficio o sea si puede haber un buen medio ambiente y en este caso uso agrícola sin estar en conflicto lo que es lo que se necesita es como ponerse de acuerdo en cuándo sacar agua en dónde utilizarla y todo esto no es un que vamos a pelearnos si existe si existen acuerdos lo que se necesita hacer pues es es voluntad no aquí se está tratando de poner esto antes de que se vayan a incorporar otros criterios en relación a la biodiversidad además de los movimientos de peces microorganismos algas leche ajá si miran claudia en lo que pasa es que el pce es el bio indicador y es en lo cual tenemos una respuesta física pero el pez es el que va adelante de todo es el que lo utiliza como indicador de todos los demás y si se necesita tanto la producción de fitoplancton zooplancton movimiento de sedimento todo eso lo estamos o sea se considera en algunos casos de forma explícita a otros de forma implícita el cristiano de porcentaje de agua usada se asocia a la actividad agrícola a quien porcentaje del agua usada se asocia lo que mira aquí realmente la cantidad de agua que se utiliza en esta cuenta y es poca con respecto a la cantidad natural el problema de esta cuenca tienen fluye alrededor de 5 a 6 kilómetros cúbicos en el aconcagua tiene un kilómetro 1.7 1.5 kilómetros cúbicos esto es mucho más grande el problema es que el 85% de estos 5 kilómetros cúbicos fluye solamente en 3 a 4 meses el 15 por ciento es en la época de sequía es una cuenta que es muy muy muy variable entonces claro en ese 15 por ciento pues todos están peleando el agua cuando no llueve y debido a eso es por eso que se están buscando estas otras alternativas al igual que proteger al medio ambiente en realidad muchas gracias emilio está considerada como consideran la variabilidad calidad físico-química de las aguas en la toma de decisiones ok estamos también haciendo modelación de temperatura porque los salmones necesitan cierta temperatura y les está diciendo en que los ríos lado la cobertura de los bosques ribereños ayuda mucho porque evita que el agua se caliente entonces si se está haciendo la modelación el este son un paso fail porque sí o sea si te pasas de la temperatura en el río aquí no es que vayan a sobrevivir sino todos se mueren entonces esa es cómo se necesita esta temperatura y para esta temperatura hay que tener esta cobertura y estos son la sitio donde no se tiene y ahí lo que hay que hacer de restauración hay quien a plantar los árboles hola muchas gracias por el seminario mi pregunta es nahuel que lo clara emilio ok me preguntáis si tienen en consideración la utilización de humedales para la distribución temporal del agua siempre solo los humedales son hasta en la parte baja esta zona cuenta que está súper superastro para encañonada océanos y pueda ver si existen humedales pero serían un poquito más delgadito y acostumbrados a los que tenemos un poco más grandes y para calidad del agua uno de los problemas que se tienen que fuerte es que la como la agricultura está en la parte alta de la montaña cuando llueve y aplican pesticidas fertilizantes se escurren a siempre de ese tamaño hay beneficios o fragmentos en este momento en eeuu estás matías para proyectos privados a escala pequeña de acumuladores de agua si existe el día y a veces provee incentivos o dinero o materiales para generar este tipo de estanques de tranques no esto es no están no están 5 no es tan difícil si existen incentivos realmente lo que se hace en el incentivo es uno a uno o sea el agricultor pone puede ser un dólar o este un beso y puede ser en forma de horas de trabajo y el estado pone en la misma cantidad se podría decir que las soluciones que están poniendo han utilizado el concepto de soluciones basadas en la naturaleza si saben si la verdad es que si algo que me queda muy claro es que el problema no es echarle concreto después vamos a pagar para tratar de volver a proveer los mismos beneficios que la naturaleza nos daba estaba hablando con él era agua nutriente de recarga de acuíferos ahorita estamos viendo en proyectos para recargar acuíferos cuando la naturaleza no lo hacía de gratis estamos en eso y tratar de no ir a ese lugar sino ver un poquito más adelante para conservar esos sitios de recarga de acuíferos para que no no tengamos después que pagar para eso hoy tengamos es el agente que paga impuestos isabel se podría decir que la solución no es hoy son matías muchas gracias por la presentación mauricio tolosa ya lo conocía antes buenas tardes en california se restringe la superficie cultivar bueno eso no no se restringe y ese ha sido el problema del vice central forever en el programa que vimos del valle central de que se estaba hundiendo es porque nunca se ha restringido la agrícola ahora ya está lo que se va a manejar por lo que estaban finalmente manejando es el el este la cantidad de agua y para serte sincero en algunas zonas de california donde vimos que estaba esa sobreexplotación se les va a recortar el agua se les y es muy probable que aunque en esta zona casi una cuarta parte de la de una quinta parte a una décima parte de las hectáreas se va a recortar porque sí o sea hay mucho más cantidad que de superficie de riego tenemos que seguir con la prenda solamente de lo que queda una pregunta que escapa un poco la que estaba haciendo antes y tiene que ver sobre de hecho la última cual es la capacidad computacional es elevar el almacenamiento y procesamiento de datos donde se realizan más allá de la parte investigación me gustaría enfocar esa pregunta si es que también cubre eso en cómo sé dónde están almacena toda la decisión a nivel en este caso estatal que tiene lo podríamos incluso dar un nivel nacional cuál sería la agencia involucradas de hacerlo primero de eso si ya cambiamos la agencia se llaman este resort ses control board la agencia estatal de que maneja los derechos de agua ellos son los que hacen o reúne entonces a tomas de decisiones la modelación y los y los datos quizás aquí algo de los mensajes como que me gustaría dejarles es no es una es toda la parte política o de decisiones de reglas se entiende por un lado y el otro es la parte un poco más técnica de dónde están las oportunidades todos estos modelos y todo no lo sé yo sé que los dos van de la mano y sin embargo ahí lo que me gustaría decirles es que no porque no se pueda de forma legislativa o de forma regulatoria no es no es necesario no no podemos explorar la de forma técnica o sea podemos adelantarnos ver qué estrategias funcionan o no y después de ahí ver cómo se puede modificar cambiar los cambios o sea si se hace un cambio se puede ser un incremento no cambia la ley actual la otra pues el borrón y cuenta nueva será una nueva ley y eso es un poco más difícil entonces dentro de estas estrategias hay que ver cuáles es necesita un cambio incremental hoy es también dentro del reglamento y cuál es sin estar en un cambio general y ahí yo lo que es más más que decirles que no vayan por todo es que al contrario hay que explorarlo hay muchas gracias muchas gracias a todos gracias gracias por la presentación excelente para nosotros también es decir es poder tener la experiencia de las distintas las distintas temáticas bueno siguiendo siguiendo con nuestra agenda ahora que puede dejar con ustedes la presentación de la doctora alejandra cugno alejandra alejandra es la encargada de este la gestión de este proyecto desde yusidey visible alejandra la la coordinadora agronómica de lúcida y visible del centro del centro universal y fomenta lavanchy la que también llegó hace cinco años a chile apoyado también por corfo en realidad como muchas cosas en este país y eso siempre es bueno alejandra sin más presentación de juego [Música] con todo el escenario virtual tuyo gracias a mauricio déjenme compartir mi pantalla y poner mi timing bueno perderme en el tiempo ok bueno primero quiero darles la bienvenida a todos y a todas las que están conectadas hoy día con nosotros y contarles un poco desde la mirada del centro este proyecto que se llama central de información y modelación hídrica si me como un proyecto colaborativo en la cuenca del aconcagua la agenda en estos 20 minutos la presentación que voy a tener con ustedes es un poco contarles que yo si baby chiles y situarlos en el aconcagua que es en la localidad la cual nosotros estamos ejecutando el proyecto contables del proyecto cine que es el proyecto cine que significa los datos que tiene en línea la modelación o simulación que hemos venido trabajando con sammy con javier ahí les voy a contar un poco más de nuestros equipos de trabajo la gobernanza y modelos de sustentabilidad la metodología de trabajo que aquí quiero agradecer mucho a los equipos de las juntas de vigilancia de la primera la segunda la tercera sección y también putaendo también quiero agradecer el apoyo del per frutícola de corfo y de la dirección general de agua ha sido un trabajo colaborativo por eso quiero hacer a todos es fácil mi presentación con respecto a esto lo que les voy a presentar ahora es un trabajo de equipo de un grupo de personas y luego un resumen y relevando los puntos más importantes y los agradecimientos bueno qué yusidei de chile como comentaba mauricio y ossie davis chile es un centro de la universidad de california davis que está acá en chile y quiere financiado desde el año 2015 por corfo y que tiene como misión entregar al mercado de la sociedad soluciones tecnológicas basadas en la ciencia a través de la investigación colaborativa el desarrollo y la transferencia de tecnología además generó el impacto económico y desarrollo social en tres áreas ambiente agricultura y alimentos el proyecto que les voy a presentar hoy día está diría que en esta intersección entre ambiente y agricultura nosotros trabajamos desde la investigación el desarrollo la innovación y extensión y la transferencia tecnológica y vamos construyendo puentes entre equipos de trabajo de california davis y aquí y nuestros socios en chiles bueno el aconcagua la cuenca del aconcagua como información general la superficie total de la cuenca es de más de 7.000 kilómetros cuadrados que incluye 5 provincias valparaíso marga marga quillota san felipe y los andes estas cinco provincias corresponden e incluyen 20 comunas que van desde quintero en el poniente hasta rinconada en el oriente con un total de habitante la sumatoria de cada una de las provincias que nos da más de un millón y medio de habitantes las principales industrias está la minería agrícolas y su ganado italia la extensión del río aconcagua es de 399 mil metros infracción 399 kilómetros con un caudal medio promedio histórico del 31,1 metros cúbicos por segundo es el valor tomado en chacabuco el aporte recibe como dos ríos no más importante el río colorado de putaendo como ríos de aporte al aconcagua y en el lago la cuenta tiene variada un lado en montañoso pero el más importante es la laguna del inca que tiene un área de 17 kilómetros cuadrados el aconcagua tiene como agrupaciones aquí pueden ver a la izquierda de la diapositiva varias agrupaciones con algún grado de personalidad jurídica y si se dan cuenta la mayoría de las agrupaciones en la cuenca están relacionados al agua son un total de 379 agrupaciones de la cuenca y 1 293 están asociadas al agua entiéndase por asociaciones de canalistas junta de vigilancia pr etcétera ahora bien enfocándonos en la producción agrícola si ustedes ven en el eje de las íes por provincia están todas las provincias que incluye la cuenta y en el eje de las equis van a encontrar el porcentaje de los productores agrícolas de cada una de las provincias se fijan en la provincia de marga marga y quillota son las provincias que albergan la mayor cantidad de pequeños agricultores quise hacer este hincapié en esta información porque la información que nosotros desplegamos en la página web es para todo tipo de usuario y la idea es alcanzar no sólo los usuarios a los grandes productores articulaciones que también a los pequeños la información hidrométrica sanitaria publicada por la dirección general de agua en su ficha para la cuenca incluye 27 26 estaciones de medición con el código prefijo 0 54 en su página web agua potable urbana hay 200 más de 227.000 arranques que abastecen a 758 mil y fracción persona habitante el resto se surte con aguas potables rurales están organizadas alrededor de 81 pozos el proyecto sin mí es un proyecto de la línea de bien público apoyado por corfo el acrónimo si me significa central de información y modelación hídrica como ya saben este este proyecto está ejecutado por el centro y occidente chile cuyo mandante la dirección general de agua los coejecutores son las tres secciones de la junta de vigilancia del aconcagua y los asociados ha interesado está el programa estratégico regional de fruticultura sustentable de valparaíso esval y la junta de vigilancia el río putaendo y codelco el período de ejecución de este proyecto es desde diciembre de 2018 hasta noviembre del 2021 en el proyecto si me tiene como principal objetivo es el objetivo general desarrollar e implementar una plataforma web de hidrometría superficial subterránea en tiempo real para fortalecer la gestión sustentable del agua y dar apoyo a la toma de decisiones en distribución y uso del recurso hídrico este proyecto tiene cuatro etapas que parten en diciembre del 2018 y terminan en noviembre del 2021 y los quiero situar un poco que es lo que nosotros hemos venido haciendo como trabajo en equipo ha sido primero la etapa 1 en la cual se desarrolló el bien público se eligió modelo se tomó un modelo entregado con la dirección general de agua que se denomina uip modo flow nativo y además se habilitó una plataforma web de información que les voy a explicar a continuación en esta etapa de final listo para pasar a la etapa 2 y es de transferencia y en lo que hemos estado haciendo estos meses tenemos tres manuales de operación de la página web estamos trabajando en vídeos de funcionamiento que vamos a colocar a disposición en la página web y en tanto del modelo como de la página web en sí y estamos partiendo la etapa número 3 de difusión en la cual tenemos una batería de talleres de operación y aplicación ya en forma paralela hemos y él ha sustentado el tiempo el proyecto propiamente tal y esta es la página web para que ustedes la tengan y puedan consultarla y puedan ver de qué se trata como ustedes pueden ver acá en esta foto tiene varias pestañas está la información en línea en la cual pueden ver todas las estaciones que tenemos incluidas en la página web las estaciones incluidas en la de que son de la dirección general de agua las estaciones de la junta de vigilancia la sección 1 de la sección 2 y de la sección 3 ellas ubicadas geográficamente dentro de este mapa que se despliega una vez que ustedes hacen clic en la página de inicio también tenemos una pestaña de reporte una pestaña de históricos e históricos de datos que van desde el año 2018 en adelante a la fecha y de simulación o modelación con el modelo que les mencionaba anteriormente with modo flow más nativo que incluye datos desde el año 1950 a la fecha ya acá también está la pestaña proyecto que cuenta que es el proyecto en detalle y recursos que es la que nosotros denominamos nuestra biblioteca digital ahora las estadísticas del uso web del uso de esta página web les quiero dar 22 un poco de atención fíjense que la mayoría de los usuarios de la página web desde noviembre a la fecha se conectan a través de sus teléfonos de su de sus teléfonos celulares de sus móviles y sólo un 28% de su computador ya eso habla de que el usuario está constantemente consultando la página a través de su teléfono la otra imagen muestra que desde noviembre a la fecha tenemos 72 3% de nuevos visitantes de la página y de visitantes que siempre nos están [Música] consultando la página de un 27% ya tenemos un público cautivo de alrededor 30 por ciento ahora cuál es la magnitud de los datos que esta página despliega ya hay un total de 60 estaciones de medición de las cuales 19 corresponden a la dirección general de agua 22 a la junta de vigilancia en la primera sección del río aconcagua 18 a la a la segunda sección de del río aconcagua a la junta de vigilancia y una a la junta de vigilancia de la tercera sección si ustedes ven a su derecha esta tabla la construir para que tengan una idea de qué parámetros mide en relación a cuánto número de estaciones y los parámetros que miden tenemos que la mayoría de las estaciones lo que nos entrega es caudal en metros cúbicos por segundo pero también hay estaciones que nos entregan información de nieve información de precipitación acumulada y otras como nivel de agua en el caso de las estaciones subterráneas ahora con relación a los reportes y esto son documentos que o muy bien [Música] formatos de información que los mismos usuarios nos han ido solicitando con el tiempo aquí ustedes pueden ver que uno puede solicitar las estaciones de los datos instantáneos haciendo clic en aconcagua san felipe aconcagua romeral colocando el periodo y haciendo clic en descargar el reporte y ustedes van a observar un documento como como el que observar en el ala derecha de la de la figura aquí están los datos para con cagua para san felipe y para cóncavo romeral en la última semana registrada del mes de agosto y también pueden ver los datos históricos yo les comentaba que existen los datos históricos para las estaciones de aconcagua chaca boquita oncca o romeral y san felipe desde el año 2018 a la fecha y también los históricos de las estaciones que se despliegan en la figura ya pueden ustedes hacer clic desde 5 minutos hasta los últimos 5 años la central de información y modelación hídrica tiene una pestaña denominada simulación con modelación en esta pestaña nosotros utilizamos las salidas de un modelo que se llama with modo flow nativo que fue entregado por la dirección general de aguas al equipo de trabajo de virus y davis en diciembre del año 2019 esta posibilidad tiene como fin explicarle en palabras bien simples lo que hace este modelo ya a través de un flujo de trabajo y entre paréntesis yo les puse un display med para que tengan muy claro que en la página web los datos que se observan en simulación son las salidas de este modelo ya este modelo funciona con input mensuales de evaporación de dos estaciones de la energía bill cuya idiota y también de las estaciones de precipitación san felipe putaendo en recuerdo los patos y limache las cuales son procesados en ml python y lo anterior ingresa como correctiva escorrentía superficial y subterránea cuencas de entrada y laterales entran al modelo uip que el modelo subterráneo que ocupa el módulo nativo y el cual a su vez van a ingresando los datos de evapotranspiración de cultivo en los sectores de riego que están determinados por esto por este por defaul yo en este modelo y también los caudales de estaciones fluido métricas que son las más consultada y las más comunes en la cuenca del aconcagua que son chacabuco romeral y san felipe e ingresan a este modelo este modelo alimenta la recarga subterránea y el cual se trabaja en otro sistema que se llama grand water visto en versión 7 y entrega a los niveles de agua subterránea en 56 puntos y además para poder nosotros entender como equipo cómo funciona el modelo realizamos en conjunto con javier tamaño en nuestro hidrólogo un diagrama bonificar el cual va mostrando como ustedes pueden ver en la simbología los embales las laterales los sectores de riego los tramos de río y los acuíferos que son los chats los sectores de hidrológicos de aprovechamiento común y la escorrentía superficial y si se fijan nosotros lo que hicimos para poder entender bien el modelo fue hacer un esquema en forma bien simple desde oriente hasta poniente incluyendo las demandas y las ofertas del modelo en cuanto a agua una vez que entendimos bien el modelo superficial lo que hicimos fue hacer una corrida histórica desde el año 1950 hasta el 2018 en primera instancia y el que ahora estamos trabajando en la corrida desde el inicio del 2019 hasta en marzo del 2020 ya si ustedes se fijan en esta figura pueden observar los datos simulados en azul y los datos observados en rojo y si se fijan el modelo entregado por la dga se ajusta muy bien a lo que realmente ocurrió ya aquello hay un leve desfase entre los años 90 y 94 ya nosotros confeccionamos esta figura y la entregamos al equipo y el grupo de discusión de una forma de que entendieran de que el modelo si simula lo que efectivamente ocurre ya también hicimos cálculos de estadísticos de ajuste que en específico la junta de vigilancia en la segunda sección nos pidió ya por tiempo no les voy a mostrar pero fueron los estadísticos nativos los que calculamos con respecto a la gobernanza y el modelo sustentabilidad de este proyecto colaborativo nosotros partimos identificando los factores relevantes en la cuenca y luego nos fuimos acercando en forma más local a lo que pudiese ser nuestra forma legal de corporación y es lo que nosotros estamos tratando de armar para poder asegurar la sustentabilidad del proyecto que lo que siempre discutimos en las reuniones para nosotros es tener algún grado de sustentabilidad del proyecto necesitamos algún grado de gobernanza y esa gobernanza la estamos logrando con los actores relevantes en la cuenca qué son las juntas de vigilancia principalmente y el programa estratégico regional fruticultura sustentable para la quinta región sin dejar de lado la figura de un consejo asesor que tenga en dentro de este consejo asesor universidades que tengan presencia local la dh la comisión nacional de riego representantes de las comunidades de agua subterránea que se están conformando recientemente las empresas que tienen interés en reforzar sus lazos con actores relevantes en la cuenca como es code con minería y también como eje fall como empresa sanitaria dentro de la gobernación modelo sustentabilidad para nosotros como equipo ha sido fundamental la metodología de trabajo y en ello quiero destacar la colaboración continua frecuente consistente responsable documental y organizada que ha venido realizando el equipo símil con el aporte de la junta de vigilancia la dirección general de agua y corfo vamos realizando avance en relación a los objetivos revisamos los indicadores discutimos acordamos tenemos actas que sean enviadas y oficializada y tenemos un seguimiento y registro de la operación y a petición de nuestro mandante aumentamos las frecuencias de reuniones a dos veces al mes estas y se ponen esta figura porque la figura superior nos muestra cómo nos reuníamos antes la figura de abajo izquierda como nos estamos reuniendo estuve una pequeña reunión y como a lo mejor nos vamos a tener que reunir a futuro al aire libre o siguiendo una mezcla del aire libre y siguiendo por las reuniones en zoom los indicadores de avance la etapa 1 tenemos un modelo validado hasta marzo el 2020 y necesitamos seguir discutiendo con nuestros actores relevantes los escenarios ya hicimos en la etapa dos talleres digamos cinco talleres ejecutados y grabados tres manuales y vídeos de operación y en la etapa 3 estamos organizan 12 talleres y la etapa 4 los tres modelos de sustentabilidad 7 servicio identificado y acuerdo de una conversación de una corporación quiero agradecer en él para finalizar mi representación en verdad a todas las personas que están detrás de este proyecto que son en orden de cordillera mar rodrigo rivero de la primera sección en este hombre de la segunda sección santiago mata de la tercera sección danielle de blasis de putaendo a corfo nuestro ejecutivo pablo díaz dirección general de agua a la pamela garcía y a mauricio lorca muchas gracias por su apoyo el perfil de valparaíso quiero agradecer en especial a kurt new link y a pierina que siempre han estado apoyándonos a esval quiero agradecer es recientemente oscar diera gracias por tu tiempo y sentarte a conversar con el grupo también a la gente de codelco que nos has facilitado los datos de nieve a través de la primera sección y al equipo de ellos y dave y en especial a javier caamaño nuestro ideólogo a roberto fuente nuestro haití la persona detrás de la página web a rodrigo riquelme hizo todo el trabajo inicial de contacto y colaboración quiero dedicarles esta frase a todo el equipo de civil que de alguna forma hemos hecho no hemos levantado con valentía y con un propósito claro que es apoyar la gestión hídrica la cuenca lo con caguas así que con eso me despido y abierta a las preguntas y gracias por su atención mi correo está abajo y la dirección de nuestro centro está también ahí muchas gracias vas a granxa alejandra por la presentación hay varias varias preguntas aparte de algunos comentarios y sobre el nivel de información que se halla manejando obviamente muchos que en el link a poder ver ahí tú javier tamaño en el chat dejo puesto ya el link de la página de la de la plataforma si me que está aún en desarrollo y algunas preguntas bien concretas alejandra una bien específica [Música] entiendo que lo que hace es exactamente metodología encargó un estudio de plan estratégico para esta cuenca la cual considera la actualización de ambos modelos wi-fi el mod demostró tienes pensado que tenemos pensado comparar estas nuevas versiones de la plataforma es una buena pregunta y eso lo hemos estado nosotros discutiendo en las reuniones nosotros que abre ya como dice sam sandoval destripamos el modelo lo entendemos mucho más pero nosotros por por tiempo por marco de tiempo del proyecto estamos trabajando con la versión que nos entregaron en diciembre del 2019 una sería un desafío para el equipo poder incluir pero no está dentro de nuestro marco de proyecto por un tema temporal se habla sobre sí sobre el tema de nieve reciben y dales el examen tal vez aquí es el problema no tienen un moderador que también ha participado en estas cosas es parte de instituciones 'este estrenaban inyectó este proyecto nace antes de que el proyecto empezará como tal nos da la verdad es que el proyecto bien público que corso impulso y apoyo cubre una una sección de lo que nosotros como yusidei de chile con experiencia de california que hicimos en el momento plantear en chile y el modelo completo sea integrar toda la parte nivel los usos de agua agua urbana agua potable rural tiene un modelo mayor y que además de escalable a nivel nacional contar millones y millones ahora que está de nuevo no es un instrumento que desde millones y millón de dólares para poder hacer esto a nivel a nivel nacional que obviamente no depende una institución sino que depende una integración de muchas instituciones como bien sanz nos mostró en su primera la primera presentación de diría este proyecto desde nuestro punto de vista como you say visible es es un piloto a un piloto que puede crecer en términos en términos espaciales en los mismos términos que usas sanos el otro es su presentación que puede ser replicable muchos en muchas cuencas claramente el modelo matemático o los modelos que ya tiene desarrollado una forma ya existen o van a seguir siendo perfeccionado a futuro este lo complejo lo interesante es como el modelo de compartir información de validar la información el que baje un grande nuevo requerimiento futuro yo diría que se fueron los grandes desafíos de este proyecto y fue poner en la mesa de la información que antes si bien estará no estaba puesta en la mesa ya y poder trabajar en base a información común los modelos para ser perfeccionable a futuro la tecnología nos remite en el mejor trata a uno pero como bien se dijo es necesario saber qué vamos a hacer con esa información no es la ciencia detrás no es que nos sigamos dando vuelta con los modelos ampa nos lo dijo antes los científicos van a seguir dándose vuelta con el modelo para reflexionar levantar los coeficientes vamos mejorar lo que cuadra altera etcétera pluralidad esto es para tomar decisiones y una de las decisiones que yo para puerto conexiones que saber la información es válida sirve es perfecta no nunca siempre puede ser perfecto y ojalá podamos integrar cada vez más variables dentro de esta iniciativa los corrientes se alejan de estas iniciativas finitas son proyectos son programas de estado a largo plazo pero lo que ya hemos conseguido es que tenemos agencias de estado la dga lo que sirva prácticamente corfo también estás en una serie de programas que tienen que ver con agua en otros ámbitos se está formando se están formando alianzas entre distintas universidades en nosotros por ejemplo por yosi directv ya estamos en la naturalidad esa grande con la universidad concepción con la universidad católica con la universidad de chile trabajando en cómo poder ir mejorando no esta plataforma sino que muchas más y cómo ir abordando los temas de agua a nivel nacional aprovechando desde luego una experiencia y como escuches no era agua llenar 10 días sino que el ruinas del saldo y abre las más tempranos de calidad de agua aprovechemos los errores que cometió california no los comentamos nosotros a ella ya ya metieron la pata en algunas cosas dijimos que el control de la pata los dólares los dos los pesos podemos pagarlos y eso está mal aquí marisio algo que está haciendo vale que estamos haciendo aquí con respecto a la pregunta que cristian estrada nos envía y es que o sea nosotros no vamos a evaluar ahorita la recarga artificial pero con el equipo de javier y ya le hemos estado generando videos en los cuales mostramos como en la plataforma general y luego cómo operar el modelo es decir estamos tratando dejar todas las cm las guías para que los usuarios después puedan utilizar el modelo y puedan este hacer sus propias modificaciones a aplicaciones ver sus ideas no entonces es también parte de la sustentabilidad que hemos estado trabajando ahí con con alé que es una vez que nosotros ya tengamos el proyecto y que lo cumplamos nuestros objetivos como dejarlo para que no les pase lo que a nosotros nos pasó que es aquí está el modelo y ahora el puedes darle lo yo también quiero adicionar ahí en nuestro en nuestras reuniones de discusión con el proyecto ya hemos nosotros discutió tres escenarios posibles de sustentabilidad y esa sustentabilidad económica y dentro de los servicios que nosotros hemos identificado que sería interesante es seguir modelando seguir estudiando la cuenca y entregar reportes reportes anuales reportes mensuales y el fondo y recogiendo el interés de los usuarios de la cuenca el término de información y de modelación y en eso lo hemos nutrido bastante con los talleres iniciales que hicimos vi azul en el cual escuchamos a los miembros de las juntas de vigilancia para entender un poco en qué ellos estaban interesados en ver escuchar a los usuarios para nosotros ha sido de mucha importancia gracias gracias alejandra por la presentación gracias am por la presentación anterior y por el trabajo que también desde california se ha hecho en este proyecto puntual que les repito la idea nuestra de este webinar en la parte es mostrar lo que se está haciendo el proyecto pero también hacer disponible a toda la comunidad de chile a todos los usuarios a todos los actores que tienen que ver con el agua lo que está disponible en la experiencia de california bueno y ahora para ir cerrando solamente con 81 todas estas excelentes ah a rodrigo a rodrigo rivero el gerente de btr la gente de la primera de la primera sección para que más de hernán algunas palabras finales y me escuchen y si escuchamos gracias muchas gracias por la invitación pero bueno sobre todo gracias a dios y babies a todo el equipo que ha trabajado cada vez en la región en este proyecto azzam sandoval por por venir tan lejos pero de verdad siento porque este este proyecto como se menciona en algún minuto un proyecto que nace común que nos cuesta mucho es muy frecuente ver qué ocurre con nosotros en el aconcagua creo que sobran son los problemas y los conflictos sin embargo hace un tiempo ya estamos empeñados en buscar soluciones comunes para el problema común que tenemos al final tratando de solucionar las cosas solo no nos ha ido tan bien entonces estamos tratando de buscar la forma de solucionar las en conjunto y una de las primeras cosas que surgió como como viable de hacer y que un problema que voy a meter todos los que hacemos gestiones aquí en cualquier lado en la necesidad de contar con información confiable y común sobre la cual mirar y te recuerdo y así salió este proyecto qué amablemente cuerpo financió qué yo si veis como el desafío de hacer y que a los cuales se sumó también con mucho ánimo y ganas a la dga y otros actores más apoyaron títulos mencionarte alejandré de hierro es el gran mérito que tiene este proyecto ahora claramente viene a tratar de solucionar las preguntas que nos hagamos y yo quiero hacer un en pacientes hoy yo creo que este proyecto es un inicio una fecha de término y que si queremos que esto sea una herramienta que nos sirva en el futuro tenemos que ver la manera de que eso ocurra y ocurrir siempre y cuando sea una herramienta que nos sirva entonces en ese sentido es súper relevante que responde a las preguntas que tenemos de parte de los usuarios tenemos que ser capaces plasmar o ser claros en cuáles son esas preguntas [Música] y así puedes construir la vimos que la plataforma apenas fue construida lo primero que hizo fue de poner a disposición la pregunta que nos hacemos todos los días en la mañana cuánta agua borchardt sacado kilos al principio romeros y sólo respondiendo a esa pregunta logramos tener todas las visitas que tú estés la página y la valoración es que hasta el momento hemos conseguido imágenes de la cantidad de otras preguntas que podemos resolver teniendo toda la información de la cuenca en un solo lugar y con la posibilidad de sacarle el nido con el modelo o con la ingeniería que podamos meterle a todos esos datos yo creo que hay un gran pueden ser la caja y tenemos que ver hacerlo crecer y cuánto crees cava de dónde eres exclusivamente de los mismos que hicimos hacer esto que somos los usuarios ciertos los principales necesitados de toda esa información y también el resto de la comunidad de esta información está disponible para todo el mundo y también es importante que la comunidad también tenga acceso a esa información eso nomás quería meter la gracia y también saludos una gracia de escuchar la voz de quienes son los que finalmente utilizan de mayor manera está esta plataforma y con quienes partimos también con todas estas conversaciones de hacer más les diría que cree años atrás que parte de la conversación ante estas estas cosas nos nace en cuanto con spacex a crear nacen como lo menos de un año antes las las reuniones el levantamiento de los libatique así de potenciales soluciones bueno muchas gracias a todos con esto damos damos cierre a este webinar de seminario gracias por la participación de los métodos entonces 100 participantes siguen apareciendo en pantalla mantuvimos la atención o una rotación muy muy muy uniforme usted es el vamos a seguir manteniendo informado de futuras futuras actividades no solamente en el marco de la cuenca sino que además en lo que estamos haciendo en agua intensamente en las próximas semanas hay temas que no solamente van en el manejo de las cuencas sino que también en cómo ser más eficiente en el uso de intermediar cómo lidiar con las sequías de mejor forma también en todas sus perspectivas y les aseguro que california tiene mucha mucha experiencia que vamos a seguir compartiendo con ustedes en distintas series de seminarios con distintos con distintos profesores de la calidad como cosas que ha participado activamente en este proyecto también nos lo empieza a relacionar el doctor fotógrafo que también ha participado intensamente en este proyecto desde california bueno los seguiremos manteniendo al tanto no sólo de esto sino lo que podemos hacer en agua niell a nivel nacional y bueno las próximas que no sepamos tener la suerte que sea en español muchas presentaciones pero bueno ahí buscaremos cómo ir acortando el veto también del idioma por lo pronto también los dejo invitados que estén en el mundo de los alimentos de la industria de los alimentos el agro el jueves tenemos un nuevo webinar que tiene que con los temas de economía circular que también ha estado trabajando más de cerca con el ministerio de agricultura y que bueno también circularán un tema netamente vamos a dedicar hasta el agua está metida

So if you're a beginner or amateur this video is for you. Watch these TUTORIALS to go from ZERO to PRO : https://creatinghq.com/editingblueprint CONNECT WITH ME: E-mail: mriduvideos@gmail.com Follow me on INSTAGRAM @mridumneog https://www.instagram.com/mridumneog/ #videoediting 374 comments today I'm going to show you how I started video editing completely from scratch as a noob and work my way up to become a pro so if you watch Tian chances are you learn what took me 7 years in just 7 Minutes well so when I started out 7 years ago there were tutorials out there to learn the technicalities of video editing but there were none to guide me through the entire process leading up to becoming aov so this video is going to be there so the date was 15th October 2016 the day when I made my first ever edit and posted it to YouTube and this is what it look [Music] like I know it's stress so will your video be when you start out so how do you improve at this stage well you need to strengthen your base as a video editor you know what allows B Khalifa to be the tallest building in the world is the strong Foundation that lies underneath and that prevents it from falling off similarly as a beginner you need to develop your foundation and strengthen your base in order to be a good video editor in the future now comes the question how do you strengthen your base after posting that first video I realized how much I was laging behind and the only way to learn for me was to create more videos so I posted one more video and one more and one more and I kept editing and posting my own videos these first edits of my life really help me to learn the basics and develop my skills well I'm not really a fan of giving advice but if there's one thing you could take away from my experience it would be just get going and learn the basics there's mainly three video editing softwares that's widely used by Pros Adobe Premier Pro DCI resolve and Final Cut Pro and you can't really go wrong with any of them regardless of whichever one you choose I'll link a few tutorials in the description go through them understand your software of choice and most importantly get your first 10 edits across but something that I should have learned at an early stage and I ignored at the time would be shortcut keys shortcut keys not only make you a faster editor but it also saves you a ton of time here are a few shortcut keys for Premier Pro W resolve and Final Cut Pro after I got my first 10 edits across I started showing a liking for travel videos and I remember I was mind blown looking at this crazy transitions I used to spend hours looking at tutorials learning and copying these transitions in my own videos although I'm not into those kind of edits nowadays that is what essentially helped me to develop my skills anyways for me it was those trendy travel videos but for you it can be anything The Boll sequence that you see online on your Tik Tok or reals a trailer of a movie a effect used in a music video anything thing that interests you look at tutorials and try to replicate it and that will ultimately help you to be better at using your editing software but wait as a beginner where would you get all the clips to practice editing well for me I used to shoot my own Clips on my phone which used to be very low quality and also take up a lot of time but luckily nowadays you can start right away with high quality footage which is where today's sponsor can help you out story blocks is a video production platform that offers a massive library of over a million stock footage templates music sound effects images and more so what does it mean for you well as a beginner you don't need to stress out about finding resources to edit a video everything you need in order to create a video is present right here at an affordable subscription this is useful not only for beginners but also for the amateures pros content creators filmmakers any type of creative for example in the filming of this video where I showed my video editing career there were many parts where I couldn't get Bolls off guess what I did I used stock footage from story blocks if I had downloaded stock footage from other sites I would have to pay for each clip and in story blocks everything's covered in just one subscription it's high quality you have unlimited downloads it has a individual license as well as a business license so it's an incredibly useful tool link is in the description if you want to go and check it out thank you so much story blocks for sponsoring this video by the time I had made my first 20 edits I had developed a decent sense of the technicalities of editing meaning I could edit a visually good-look video and I had edited quite a few travel videos with cool Transitions and music but my edits essentially lacked something thing there was no emotion and I failed to deliver a feeling that's mainly because I was not looking at editing as storytelling I failed to understand the psychological aspects of editing and I was merely looking at it as a technical task if you are a video editor you essentially have to think like a filmmaker regardless of whichever genre of video editing you are into and the most basic film editing technique that is widely used by editors is the coolish sh effect the coolish off effect is the idea that two shots in a sequence make more meaning than a single shot by itself self for example here's a shot of my friend looking at something with neutral Expressions now let me show you how we can derive different meanings using just this shot and one more shot let's place the shot of my friend and then cut to a shot of a glass of water and again let's cut back to the shot of my friend now as the viewer tell me what meaning can you make out of this it definitely depicts that he is feeling thirsty right now let's replace the second shot with a video of someone's grave now my question for you is the same what meaning can you make out of this sequence this might mean that he is feeling sad because of loss of a loved one right similarly we as video editors can make different meanings out of our shots just by placing two shots in a sequence in combination with each other now this was just one example but there are a Tor of other techniques used in film editing look at editing breakdowns of movies look at look at interviews of editors listen to podcasts like the editing podcasts take notes and apply whatever you can onto your own edits I have linked a few resources in the description where you can learn all about the film making aspects of editing if you have learned the technical and the psychological aspects of editing then congratulations now you're an amateur to put it simply what separates an amateur from a pro is his or her ability to earn from their skills and in our case it's video editing back when I was at this stage I would take up any work that I could get I would even work for free and get reached out by local clients and I remember I used to create a YouTube playlist and add my best work to it so what I was doing at that time was building my portfolio so you may ask what the hell is a portfolio portfolio is nothing but your body of for and it can be in any form a YouTube playlist a Google drive folder your own website or it can even be a show real we just have to keep in mind that a portfolio is nothing but a convenient way of showing your clients your work what you should essentially be focusing on is having better quality work in your portfolio up until 2021 I had edited quite a few videos and that is when I learned to deal with clients be a pleasure to work with and deliver your best output because ultimately you would want those clients to hire you again and again and that is what's going to generate income by 2022 I had developed the skills to deal with clients and built up a fairly good portfolio by working with a few Brands as well but I was getting work very inconsistently meaning some months would be very busy while some months I would not get any work at all so I knew I had to step up my game so instead of waiting for clients to reach out to me I knew I had to take a proactive approach to it so I decided to take some time off my freelance videoing career and I finally decided to restart my YouTube channel properly and within a few months my YouTube channel Channel grew and my videos reached out to a worldwide audience and this is when everything changed I got reached out by many International clients and I even got the opportunity to work with YouTubers like Marco so if there is anything that you can learn from my experience it would be as an amateure you should be able to Market yourself because you can be the most skilled editor in the world but if no one knows about you no one is going to hire you as simple as that so you can establish yourself as a brand and Market yourself that way but if you're someone like me one thing we all have access to is our social media use it to let the world know how skilled you are so now that you've become a pro what's next well for me I wanted to use my video editing skills to build this YouTube channel but for you it can be something else figure out what you love doing and double down on that one n be the best at it anyways there is something I'm still trying to figure out and if you're a beginner starting out you should probably be focusing on the basics first so those were a few of the things that I learned in seven years of my video editing career as a self-taught video editor and hopefully you could

https://www.instagram.com/mridumneog/ #videoediting 374 comments today I'm going to show you how I started video editing completely from scratch as a noob and work my way up to become a pro so if you watch Tian chances are you learn what took me 7 years in just 7 Minutes well so when I started out 7 years ago there were tutorials out there to learn the technicalities of video editing but there were none to guide me through the entire process leading up to becoming aov so this video is going to be there so the date was 15th October 2016 the day when I made my first ever edit and posted it to YouTube and this is what it look [Music] like I know it's stress so will your video be when you start out so how do you improve at this stage well you need to strengthen your base as a video editor you know what allows B Khalifa to be the tallest building in the world is the strong Foundation that lies underneath and that prevents it from falling off similarly as a beginner you need to develop your foundation and strengthen your base in order to be a good video editor in the future now comes the question how do you strengthen your base after posting that first video I realized how much I was laging behind and the only way to learn for me was to create more videos so I posted one more video and one more and one more and I kept editing and posting my own videos these first edits of my life really help me to learn the basics and develop my skills well I'm not really a fan of giving advice but if there's one thing you could take away from my experience it would be just get going and learn the basics there's mainly three video editing softwares that's widely used by Pros Adobe Premier Pro DCI resolve and Final Cut Pro and you can't really go wrong with any of them regardless of whichever one you choose I'll link a few tutorials in the description go through them understand your software of choice and most importantly get your first 10 edits across but something that I should have learned at an early stage and I ignored at the time would be shortcut keys shortcut keys not only make you a faster editor but it also saves you a ton of time here are a few shortcut keys for Premier Pro W resolve and Final Cut Pro after I got my first 10 edits across I started showing a liking for travel videos and I remember I was mind blown looking at this crazy transitions I used to spend hours looking at tutorials learning and copying these transitions in my own videos although I'm not into those kind of edits nowadays that is what essentially helped me to develop my skills anyways for me it was those trendy travel videos but for you it can be anything The Boll sequence that you see online on your Tik Tok or reals a trailer of a movie a effect used in a music video anything thing that interests you look at tutorials and try to replicate it and that will ultimately help you to be better at using your editing software but wait as a beginner where would you get all the clips to practice editing well for me I used to shoot my own Clips on my phone which used to be very low quality and also take up a lot of time but luckily nowadays you can start right away with high quality footage which is where today's sponsor can help you out story blocks is a video production platform that offers a massive library of over a million stock footage templates music sound effects images and more so what does it mean for you well as a beginner you don't need to stress out about finding resources to edit a video everything you need in order to create a video is present right here at an affordable subscription this is useful not only for beginners but also for the amateures pros content creators filmmakers any type of creative for example in the filming of this video where I showed my video editing career there were many parts where I couldn't get Bolls off guess what I did I used stock footage from story blocks if I had downloaded stock footage from other sites I would have to pay for each clip and in story blocks everything's covered in just one subscription it's high quality you have unlimited downloads it has a individual license as well as a business license so it's an incredibly useful tool link is in the description if you want to go and check it out thank you so much story blocks for sponsoring this video by the time I had made my first 20 edits I had developed a decent sense of the technicalities of editing meaning I could edit a visually good-look video and I had edited quite a few travel videos with cool Transitions and music but my edits essentially lacked something thing there was no emotion and I failed to deliver a feeling that's mainly because I was not looking at editing as storytelling I failed to understand the psychological aspects of editing and I was merely looking at it as a technical task if you are a video editor you essentially have to think like a filmmaker regardless of whichever genre of video editing you are into and the most basic film editing technique that is widely used by editors is the coolish sh effect the coolish off effect is the idea that two shots in a sequence make more meaning than a single shot by itself self for example here's a shot of my friend looking at something with neutral Expressions now let me show you how we can derive different meanings using just this shot and one more shot let's place the shot of my friend and then cut to a shot of a glass of water and again let's cut back to the shot of my friend now as the viewer tell me what meaning can you make out of this it definitely depicts that he is feeling thirsty right now let's replace the second shot with a video of someone's grave now my question for you is the same what meaning can you make out of this sequence this might mean that he is feeling sad because of loss of a loved one right similarly we as video editors can make different meanings out of our shots just by placing two shots in a sequence in combination with each other now this was just one example but there are a Tor of other techniques used in film editing look at editing breakdowns of movies look at look at interviews of editors listen to podcasts like the editing podcasts take notes and apply whatever you can onto your own edits I have linked a few resources in the description where you can learn all about the film making aspects of editing if you have learned the technical and the psychological aspects of editing then congratulations now you're an amateur to put it simply what separates an amateur from a pro is his or her ability to earn from their skills and in our case it's video editing back when I was at this stage I would take up any work that I could get I would even work for free and get reached out by local clients and I remember I used to create a YouTube playlist and add my best work to it so what I was doing at that time was building my portfolio so you may ask what the hell is a portfolio portfolio is nothing but your body of for and it can be in any form a YouTube playlist a Google drive folder your own website or it can even be a show real we just have to keep in mind that a portfolio is nothing but a convenient way of showing your clients your work what you should essentially be focusing on is having better quality work in your portfolio up until 2021 I had edited quite a few videos and that is when I learned to deal with clients be a pleasure to work with and deliver your best output because ultimately you would want those clients to hire you again and again and that is what's going to generate income by 2022 I had developed the skills to deal with clients and built up a fairly good portfolio by working with a few Brands as well but I was getting work very inconsistently meaning some months would be very busy while some months I would not get any work at all so I knew I had to step up my game so instead of waiting for clients to reach out to me I knew I had to take a proactive approach to it so I decided to take some time off my freelance videoing career and I finally decided to restart my YouTube channel properly and within a few months my YouTube channel Channel grew and my videos reached out to a worldwide audience and this is when everything changed I got reached out by many International clients and I even got the opportunity to work with YouTubers like Marco so if there is anything that you can learn from my experience it would be as an amateure you should be able to Market yourself because you can be the most skilled editor in the world but if no one knows about you no one is going to hire you as simple as that so you can establish yourself as a brand and Market yourself that way but if you're someone like me one thing we all have access to is our social media use it to let the world know how skilled you are so now that you've become a pro what's next well for me I wanted to use my video editing skills to build this YouTube channel but for you it can be something else figure out what you love doing and double down on that one n be the best at it anyways there is something I'm still trying to figure out and if you're a beginner starting out you should probably be focusing on the basics first so those were a few of the things that I learned in seven years of my video editing career as a self-taught video editor and hopefully you could learn a thing or two and progress even faster in your career and always remember that everyone's path is different but regardless of whichever path you choose you should always keep [Music] creating"
